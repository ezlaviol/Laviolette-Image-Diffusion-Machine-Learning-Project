2020-03-18T17:02:00+11:00 : I'm not convinced it's correct to model Australian human-human infection rates in line with infections reported. It's much more complex than that.  ~50% of our active cases are from travellers returning from overseas already infected (https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-current-situation-and-case-numbers) - already in quarantine. Globally though, the reports of cases being opened are only slightly outnumbering those being closed. You can see it quite clearly in countries like South Korea and Iran. Sharp increase in the early stages of the outbreak followed by teetering out as people become more conscious of good hygiene practices and social distancing.I think short term the market has not finished panicking, RBA announcement tomorrow could go either way. Not the time to buy yet IMO.  Of course i could be completely wrong and we'll all die on our thrones of toilet paper
