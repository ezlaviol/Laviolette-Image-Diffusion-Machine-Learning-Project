2017-02-06T08:45:00+11:00 : SYDNEY, Feb 6 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank  (NAB)   (NAB), the No. 4 lender by market value, on Monday reported a 1  percent fall in first quarter unaudited cash profit as costs  grew faster than revenue.  	NAB posted unaudited cash earnings of A$1.6 billion ($1.23  billion) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, down 1 percent from the  same period a year earlier.   	The bank said costs rose by 5 percent in part due to annual  salary increases and higher redundancy costs, while revenue rose  by 1 percent.  	The ratio of 90-days past due and total impaired assets to  gross loans rose to 0.90 percent at end-December from 0.85  percent at end-September 2016. NAB did not give a reason for the  increase. It said its net interest margin was "broadly stable".   ($1 = 1.3050 Australian dollars)
