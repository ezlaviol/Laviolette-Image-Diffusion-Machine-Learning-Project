Growth will be poor. But the core NAB business should still generate a substantial stream of earnings for shareholders, whether that is kept within the business or paid out as dividends. At the end of the day, demand for loans will return, and with that comes earnings. That's why I'm favoring bank shares over high PE multiple growth names like some tech stocks, CSL, etc.
