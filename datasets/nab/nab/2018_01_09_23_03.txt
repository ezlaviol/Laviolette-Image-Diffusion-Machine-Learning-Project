Most are going OK but I feel like a few are offering good value right now due to a slight pull-back recently, or an expected strong result in 2018.

In particular at the moment (not to cross promote but simply to answer the question) I was keen to buy more 3DP as a strong tech play, and TLM as a strong resources play. Happy to field any questions you might have on those across on their board.

In the world of finance, I've moved cash across to more speculative (and hence smaller holdings) into blockchain/crypto plays FGF and FFG. Purely for illustration sake - so far on those two I'm ahead 150% and 35% respectively so it's just a no brainer to take some capital & play in that sector rather than sit it all in NAB.

Best wishes.
