2018-12-28T10:54:00+11:00 : Has bounced well from $22.84 through resistance at $23.39.

Is this the beginning of a recovery or a mere dead cat bounce?

I'm trying to understand how much of potential 2019 negative events - e.g. elected Labor government, its impact on business and tax, softening worldwide growth, continuing trade tensions etc - are already priced in?

Very interested to hear others' thoughts.
