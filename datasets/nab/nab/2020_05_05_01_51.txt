2020-05-05T01:51:00+10:00 : Hi all, I have a newbie question as it is my first time participating in a SPP like this.Let's say I put in $30k and NAB only allocate $15k of shares after scaling back, how would they refund the excess money to me, cheque or bank transfer (via bank account registered in computershare)?I am currently living oversea and won't be back until another 5-6 months. Thanks in advance.
