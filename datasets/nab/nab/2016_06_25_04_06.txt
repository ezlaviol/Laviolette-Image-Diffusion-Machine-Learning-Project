2016-06-25T04:06:00+10:00 : Good call on gold. And holding a top Aussie company. Things reacted worse earlier this year and look what happened. I remember being all in on bank stocks a couple of years ago and being down 70k at one stage. Talk about worry! It all came back though through sp or divs. Just took some time and the worry was helped by nice divs twice a year. DJ not doing to bad. Lucky we weren't holding uk banks! Looking forward to Monday.
