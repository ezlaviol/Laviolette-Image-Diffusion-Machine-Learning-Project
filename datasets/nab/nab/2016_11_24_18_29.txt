2016-11-24T18:29:00+11:00 : NAB tracking up nicely this week. The solid upward pressure this week could push it over the $29 mark tomorrow if not next week.

We never really saw the predicted $1.00 drop ex dividend for some reason - possibly due to the timing in relation to the US election?


All IMHO -  DYO research.
