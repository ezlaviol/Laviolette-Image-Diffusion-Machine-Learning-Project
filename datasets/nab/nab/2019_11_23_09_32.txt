2019-11-23T09:32:00+11:00 : Unfortunately the Westpac debacle is going to dampen any recovery and the fact they didn't dismiss the "accountable persons" immediately it is going to drag out with extended bad publicity for all of the banks. Originally i was intending to buy extra shares under 27 but held out and still waiting , will buy in before the CEO onboards in December (2nd) , his start will give a positive sentiment but may be muted by Westpac. My position is now changed to be a slow grind , lower yet into 25's handle, then grind up to 28 , not before xmas now,  and above 31 when mlc spinoff commences.
