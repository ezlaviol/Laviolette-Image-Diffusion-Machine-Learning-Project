They should bounce back once things return to normal but it will take time and of course we really don't know the state much of the business community will be in short term.
Nab in recent times has underwritten their Dividend so if SP remains languishing due to economic conditions and a high Div is paid the main winner will be the underwriter with significant dilution from the shares issued instead of own cash used to pay non DRP users. 
For these reasons I am hoping that the next Div is either greatly reduced or suspended totally as a temporary measure until situation returns to some sort of normalcy.
Obviously the market would not like that but I think will be accepted once there is evidence that it will only be temporary.....................
