2020-04-25T17:10:00+10:00 : Until only recently testing has been limited in many countries. Even in the UK they would not test unless you had "severe" symptons. I saw a report weeks ago that Ohio had 100,000 cases (when total US reported was pretty small). Thought it was strange until I saw the actual interview with Ohio's chief medical office and Mayor. Both stated quite emphatically they were sure they had at least 100,000 cases however they only (at that time) had the capacity to test about 1,000 Obviously much more widespread testing is now a key plank for most countries.
This is all well known, however the notion that you can try and spread deaths over a shorter time frame is fraught because the simple fact is health systems all around the world cannot cope as evidenced by many (including Sweden)!!
The success of Australia in keeping cases down means we have been able to build much more ICU capacity and ventilator availability so an increase in cases can be handled. That has been the aim as most health advisors do expect disease to keep spreading in the short term, (but if your health system can handle not such an issue) 
Obviously the low cases we have means they are thinking about a much stronger level of control than they initially expected based on known modelling!
