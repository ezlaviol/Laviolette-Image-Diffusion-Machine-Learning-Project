All those points are relevant, but the market is forward looking. It has been falling because those things have been expected for the last 3 years. In that time the price has fallen from $39 down to today's $22.84.
NAB at that $39 high in early 2015 was trading at a FF div of 7.1% on prior year's div.

Personally I hopeit becomes more unpopular and falls further, so I can buy some more. I've been slowly buying a few things over the last few weeks as great companies become cheap.

None of us know what the property market will do over the next 12 months, though I expect a bit further pullback. Past property recessions usually show the big falls early, then a lot of mostly sideways movement for a few years, like in 90-96 for Melb and Syd. 

This recession will be different, they always are, but during the last recession, the banks started rising in early '91 while property still lost ground for a few years. Banks had gone down/sideways from late '87.

NAB has already been going down for 3 -4 years!!
