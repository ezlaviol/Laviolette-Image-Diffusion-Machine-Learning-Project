The massive FoxTel losses, lack of capital injection from NWS and TLS would suggest to me that the banks do not see the underlying risks and have so few people at them, they have not adequately researched the loss making nature of the industry.Did the accounts of NWS and TLS with respect to FoxTel contain this bias? One thing is inextricably linked to the other. Where is the ROI without FoxTel? AFL has not turned a profit without FoxTel since the 1980s and early 1990s. Austar went to the wall. Optus got out of Australian sport content and FoxTel made significant multi-million AUD losses ever since.The banks, NAB a sponsor, ANZ a Melbourne infected potential sucker for a consortium Line of Credit, have been suckered into a credit that the News Corporation and Telstra have never managed to get themselves out of.If it was such a good ROI and investment, why would TLS and NWS not helped them out? Because the risk is too great would be my guess? The banks will have another write off on their hands if they do ever commit to this IMHO.
