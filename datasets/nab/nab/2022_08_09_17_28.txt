However, NAB sp was pumped on expectations not on results, fell back more than 3%  today on a very week trading update.  How does that saying go "figures don't lie but you can lie with figures"?  Using a longer term time frame, NAB has unperformed in most comparisons, whereas CBA has surpassed it's pre GFC high and fallen back, differing reporting cycles.  Understand your emotional attachment to NAB, most of us have that issue from time to time but we must be rational with our investments.
