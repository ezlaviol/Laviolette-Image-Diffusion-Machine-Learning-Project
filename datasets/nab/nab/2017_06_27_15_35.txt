The issue is that states could rely on those taxes, they cant on GST (yes, even the net receiving states) as the results of the GST sharing formula changes every year.  The states should have argued for a guaranteed GST % income (eg, 75% of GST generated in their state) and hand only 25% to the Feds to dole out as they see fit.  This still has problems, but they would be less than we have now.

I agree that a fee for insurance seems fair enough.  This issue would all go away, however, if companies were taxed under a progressive tax system, like individuals are.  A little more complicated, given the levels of losses and capital offsets companies have, but nonetheless doable.  It was sort of what the resources rent tax tried, but failed miserably both in its conception and its implementation.
