2019-10-16T08:23:00+11:00 : Given the Ahmed Fahour debacle at Latitude, there needs to be a full investigation into NABâ€™s governance, risk and compliance practices to determine what is going on at NAB and how our sholder money has been, was or is squandered.All these  Big 4 consulting firms have not found a thing, half the time the bank picks the same company that did the Audit. They need some investigations internally with some real grunt or some regulatory oversight like the Federal Reserve Bank does in the United States.Change my sentiment to sell from buy. The Latitude debacle may hurt sentiment on NAB but assist the others.
