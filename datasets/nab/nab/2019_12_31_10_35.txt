Selling when the SP is near the bottom as it is now makes no logical sense at all. Having said that, the SP is jumping around a bit - still a bit fragile. That will likely happen for the next three months though the beginning of the calendar year normally sees a revival in blue chip SP's. Still likely to see NAB's SP approach $24 at some stage so maybe hold off until some upward trend becomes more obvious. I'd still hold for now though.

there would be no better time to buy banks then now. but most people are so fear driven that they just can’t make themselves do it. They don’t learn from history but always think that “this time it will be different, this time they will never recuperate” and then they do, climb terribly fast and people buy again at the top. And the circle goes around and around... Whatever the startup neo banks can do, the big four can do a hundred times better, they have the capital and in NAB’s case also the right management, the institutional backing (which is incredibly important) and the history that will tell us that they will be fine and even thrive - just like they’ve done for the past centuries and decades in countless up and downturns.
