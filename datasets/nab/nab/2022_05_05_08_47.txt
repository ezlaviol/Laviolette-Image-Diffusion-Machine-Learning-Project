2022-05-05T08:47:00+10:00 : Nab Ann'd completion of $2.5b buy back on 24th March and ann'd new buy back of $2.5b which is expected to commence after half yearly results.
No buy back for well over a month and there has been no significant change in NAB share price relative to its peers during that time to support  that claim.
(Obviously on market buy back will improve Sp through reduction of SOI, but the market also obviously expected improved performance!)
