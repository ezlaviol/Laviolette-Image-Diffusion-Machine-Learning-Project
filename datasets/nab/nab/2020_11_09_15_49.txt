I borrowed to buy NAB since the start of April, (I'm still in a hole so far because I jumped too soon), but dividends are covering the interest, just, and I'm hoping to offload them at a profit when things return to normal.  My thinking is that the Banks are all being ultra conservative and putting away huge amounts of provisions for bad debts, that may not eventuate.  In my scenario, they'll end up with a large bucket of dollars of unneeded provisions and dividends will return to normal in the latter half of 2021.  Fingers crossed.
