2016-05-19T20:10:00+10:00 : This chart (click to enlarge) indicates there is a high probability imo that NAB has resumed its downtrend. For example, RSI has dropped below 50 and MACD has made a negative cross over.



This monthly chart does not look too flash either imo. Folks are posting with bravado, "Bring on $26.00" forgetting that in early 2009 NAB was smashed down to $16.00.
