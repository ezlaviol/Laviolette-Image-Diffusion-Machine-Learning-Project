I think property will be stagnant for a long time to come. I am not in NSW/VIC so I cannot comment on those states. Its also part of the reason I am not overweight in financials (banks), but nevertheless must have exposure to banks.

I'm enjoying being debt free to be honest. Might not have been the best financial discussion but I feel great from it. We will see what does better - a mixture of ASX20 stocks or those 2 properties over the next 10 years.
