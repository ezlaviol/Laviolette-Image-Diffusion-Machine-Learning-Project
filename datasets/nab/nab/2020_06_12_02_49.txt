2020-06-12T02:49:00+10:00 : Dunno about shorts but I do know this market is a short term traders paradise. I'm sitting on the sidelines all out with around  45k profit from last month. waiting to jump back in. my goal this month is to beat my last months profit when I sell out again. the lower I get it the better. I think it could rally from $11-$16 low this time around (the worse covid gets the better) and anything higher than $17 is too expensive for a buy.
