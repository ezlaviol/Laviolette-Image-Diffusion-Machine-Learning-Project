He claimed they did a call out to 7000 customers who they regarded as vulnerable asking if they needed relief on their payments. Only 13 replied that they did. Seems people can withstand far more rate rises than the 250 basis points on which their loans were tested. Whether that's good or bad I'm not sure. Maybe the RBA raises 3 more times looking for some traction, and all the borrowers who were stress tested on the same metrics capitulate at the same time.                       Reaper.
