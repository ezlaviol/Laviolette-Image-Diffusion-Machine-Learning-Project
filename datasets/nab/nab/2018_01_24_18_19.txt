Watching a lot of Bloomberg late at night after the tennis, my guess is the financials will have a bit of a run sometime soon here in Oz. One thing I've always believed, also , is that if there were ever a bank merger, it wld be ANZ that wld get swallowed up. (It's really the big 5 with Macquarie these days) Their sp wld prob go north if that outside chance came in.
