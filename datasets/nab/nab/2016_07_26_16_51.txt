2016-07-26T16:51:00+10:00 : The bets still stands buddy. Div cut for cba. $12 for BOQ end of October. If NAb slips under 25 on some bad news I'll grab some. Pockets are full of BOQ. Announcement today was sold into but what a nice bounce at the end of the day . CBA has been charging on its div run. I'm trying to think of the most calorie filled cake I'll get you eating on the cut. Cheese cake or chocolate cake, I can't decide. Hope yr buy in cba was good enough to give you a gain on sp and the div when it comes around. 15 days to go 

Bet entry received. NAB > 27.25 by October. My take is its a winning bet.
