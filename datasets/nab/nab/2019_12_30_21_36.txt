2019-12-30T21:36:00+11:00 : Does Australia still use NPS? Really, that reminds of when we had Cathode Ray Tubes as TVs, Ronald Reagan was President, Hawke was trying to be PM, banking was done with a passbook, before laptops, cell phones. Wow, it is quaint in a way, I have not heard NPS mentioned this Century.Good to see Australian banking has discovered NPSs, Perhaps you can move to net payment platforms, branchless banking, equity mortgages and reverse mortgages, heavens knows you might join this decade’s banking and provide real time payments and portfolio mortgages, package portfolios of mortgages up in residential backed securities.there is a lot of growth and development to come for Australian banking, the future is all ahead of it. CBA’s ASB, the old Auckland Savings Bank is so backward, it is basically fossilized banking when my parents were around. Astonishingly backward.
