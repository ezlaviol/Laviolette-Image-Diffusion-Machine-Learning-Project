2016-07-28T14:41:00+10:00 : A couple of us are just using this thread to talk about bank stocks in general. Some hold BOQ an some don't. I can't give you an informed opinion I'm sorry. I'm prettily heavily invested for the exact reason you are considering. With BlackRock becoming a sub holder who knows. But I'm in because it sits at not far off lows and historically the sp has been well ahead of where it is now come ex div. Historically a small retrace in sept and a pretty decent ramp in October. Still a couple of months away and who knows what happens between now and then. Some of the banks like cba are already sitting at very high levels pre div which to me is a warning signal that after the recent pump investors may have already got their sp return and may not see much of an increase in the sp from here. BEN is already within its 47 day trading period and has been pumped hard and out of the window to invest today and claim franked credits so it's sp is struggling to gain ground IMO. Then we have our little BOQ. Plenty of time to pump it (if that's what blackrock or other institutions want to do) close to yearly lows and still 3 months away from ex.. That's why I'm in. In deep lol. Don't take this as I'm ramping it. I'm doing it purely for the div run 3 months out. Be safe out there !
