After every scandal (they tend to happen every five years) the banks improve; the low interest rate that have given space to small new banks starts to rise, kills off the new banks and give space to a new upturn era for our big banks that have the capital to withstand low interest environment and thrive in high interest environment. I am surprised that so many that  do stocks are panickers/ emotionally buying/selling and still in a ‘buy high, sell low’ frame of mine.I am not in to offend anyone. I just feel like helping those who panic and sell now. There is really no need. NAB as an example, which I am an holder of lately, is an EXCELLENT buy right now. The CEO is amazing and has an impressive record. He will do a good job. In five years time banks will be at a new high. They have the capital to survive, develop, keep up and thrive.
