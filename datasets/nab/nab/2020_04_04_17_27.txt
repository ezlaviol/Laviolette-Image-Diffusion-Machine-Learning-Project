If things get so rough that government has to step in to stop the bank from collapsing, then equity shareholders will get wiped first, no question. The gov't is in the business of bailing out depositors and the banking structure, not bank shareholders. It will already cost taxpayers a fortune to bail out the banks - they are not going to spend another fortune bailing out bank shareholders  to the tune of extra several hundred billion dollars. It makes no sense from the government perspective.See UK banks experience during the GFC on how govt quasi-nationalisation of banks play out for shareholders (hint: there's heavy dilution involved = permanent capital loss)
