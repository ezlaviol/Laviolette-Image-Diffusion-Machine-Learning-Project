The head of the broker channel at NAB has said that while “there will be uncomfortable times” in the next round of royal commission hearings.


The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry will begin its next round of public hearings on Monday (21 May).
The third round is set to focus on loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, with responsible lending and unfair contract terms coming into focus.

The hearings will consider the conduct of several of the leading banks in respect of their dealings with small and medium enterprises, in particular in providing credit to businesses.

It has already been revealed that NAB will be called to give evidence during the hearings for a case study looking at its approach to “enforcement, management and monitoring of loans to businesses”.
