Cheers JCoureI don't agree that Weibo/Chinese users asserting an Australian platform is down means it's down though. There could be connection problems traversing the great firewall of China at any given point. There are also a number of Hotcopper users that will assert Comsec/Nabtrade.Online banks are down, when they haven't performed any basic troubleshooting of their own devices/network first.I have an unrelated question (prob doesn't warrant a new thread).NAB is attractive to a lot of investors because of it's yield. I see NAB has an EPS of $1.764 (Source: Comsec platform)If it pays a dividend of $0.83 twice a year, that seems like a very high payout ratio. Do people here think that is sustainable and that the dividend of 0.83 can be maintained?(Also made me think, do you count the franking component too?)
