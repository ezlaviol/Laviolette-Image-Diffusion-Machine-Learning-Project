A bit different to the agitated posters proclaiming the death spiral for our retail banks only a short time ago.
Apparently they had missed the (already happened) market fall, or perhaps they always think you should sell low 
Whatever it was, they need to work on their timing for financial advice
(And yes, there could well be a retrace after this run and economic conditions are still up in the air........................)
