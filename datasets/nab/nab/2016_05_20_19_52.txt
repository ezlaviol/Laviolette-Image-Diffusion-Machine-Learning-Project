What exactly do you think will happen? Do you think housing prices will suddenly drop, people will not be able to repay their mortgages on 4% interest (the lowest in many decades) and default leading to bad debts and lower bank profits? ROFL 

Which planet do you live on?

Nanood is right. Experts have been predicting the housing collapse for years. In that time I have been buying property and, according to recent valuations they have all gone up substantially in value over the last two years. But we digress from NAB.

Nanood, if you have time, I would value your opinion as to what you think will happen to NAB over the next few weeks. Your timing is much better than mine. I was thinking it could climb up back to $29 over the next two weeks, judging on previous post divi values, but now I am not so sure. Assuming there are no interest rate decreases in June by the RBA do you think the SP will drop in late June before the EOFY?

Feel free to share your thoughts on the topic Lurkin if you would like.
