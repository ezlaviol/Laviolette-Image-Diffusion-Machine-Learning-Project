2020-03-23T11:55:00+11:00 : Hi team, it's a long time since I frequented the NAB discussions on HC - was a LT holder before I woke up and realised that although my strategy of compounding dividend yield was a sound long term approach, there were/are far better yielding plays on the ASX that *might* actually at some point also deliver a few % each year in capital growth so I hit the eject button.NAB has always been super predictable - generally gets hammered the hardest in any downturn, pays the highest dividend, share price will rebound with the financial sector in due course but NAB will always fail to show growth and so will always fail to match the share price gains on most other banking stocks.Having said all that - I'm watching like a hawk at sub $14 but anticipate that $12 will present and $8-$10 is not out of the question. She is now lower than at any time during the GFC so all bets are off and there is no floor here. She will simply be punished until Mr Market decides she is a buy. I suspect that will happen sub $10 based on the proportionate fall we saw during the GFC and the fact that this will be worse.Good luck to you all, if you have spare bullets don't spray them all at once because this is nowhere near over.
