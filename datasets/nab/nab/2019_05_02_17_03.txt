2019-05-02T17:03:00+10:00 : 436m of savings from this dividend cut,... I looked at page 24 of The 2019 Half Year Results Investor Presentation and saw that they have now 512m of cost savings from their Transformation Progress. As time goes by, there will be more savings, which could be channeled towards the provisions that we are facing now.I hoped the dps payout can be increased again in the medium term (as said on page 6).
