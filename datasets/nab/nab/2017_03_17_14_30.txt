2017-03-17T14:30:00+11:00 : SYDNEY, March 17 (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking  Corp  (WBC)  said on Friday it will raise mortgage rates across  a range of products including for owner occupiers, a day after  rival National Australia Bank  (NAB)  made a similar move.   	Westpac will increase its variable home loan rate for owner  occupiers by 3-8 basis points, it said in a statement. Variable  rates for property investors will be raised by 23-28 basis  points.   	On Thursday, NAB became the first of the country's Big Four  lenders to raise mortgage rates, a move that in part will be  welcomed by regulators desperate to cool runaway real estate  prices.
