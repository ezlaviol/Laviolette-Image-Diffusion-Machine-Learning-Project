2018-01-20T22:13:00+11:00 : I hold all 4 banks, with over $2.5m of current value, with significant capital gains over 3+ decades. Half of that portfolio in SMSF returning significant tax credits.

What woolydog (subsequent poster somewhat ridiculing my previous response) fails to appreciate is the power of fully franked dividends. With NAB, for example, if one purchased stock in 2001 for $29 then the tax free dividend return equates to over $30 per share, over 17 years. Again, timing is key. You could have also bought NAB for well under $20 in 2000, or $16 in 2008, or in my case a significant purchase in 1993 for $8. 

My point is hold for the long run, enjoy tax free dividend returns and bonus cap gains to boot! Credit due, some punters may say with hindsight that even greater cap gains could have been achieved with other stocks. My response is sure, invest in other non banks but I can assure you some will win and others fail. But each sensible portfolio will hold significant banks like NAB for slow and steady growth. Happy investing.
