2016-02-11T17:02:00+11:00 : Bought in today. NAB looks cheap. I remember watching NAB in the middle of the GFC and it hit $16.80 for a little bit before rebounding to around $19 - $20. I also bought some ANZ today and will continue to buy both while it hovers around this price and even if it dips further I will buy more. I have a 20 year vision for these shares and can't see NAB or ANZ being bad long term investments at these prices. If they are not a strong BUY right now it must be approaching that very soon.
