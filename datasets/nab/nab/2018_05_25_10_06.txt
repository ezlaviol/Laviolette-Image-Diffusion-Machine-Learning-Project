In my mind there is only one thing to consider - 7.4 % fully franked dividend or 10.57% pre tax dividend. Compare that to investing your money in NAB term deposit - lucky to get a 2.5% pre-tax yield.

Banking inquiry - its not like no-one knew banks were doing some dodgy stuff. But in my view, the inquiry would be better named as financial planning inquiry, as that is the industry which is really coming out looking bad from this inquiry. And banks don't make all that much money from their financial planning. They should go back to their core business of lending which is what a lot of the banks are doing now.

I can't see property market crashing as there is too much demand for property thanks to our immigration policy and Australia being such a great place to live.

I have recently loaded up on NAB. I just see current SP as a great opportunity to buy, with limited downside thanks to the dividend yield. Even if SP doesn't go up, the yield is great. I can't recall seeing a big 4 bank at 7.4% ff yield.
