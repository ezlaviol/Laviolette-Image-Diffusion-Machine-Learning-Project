2020-03-15T17:44:00+11:00 : I was excited to see a bounce, it is helpful to figure out a bottom, which could very well be @ $11-$12This is far worse than the GFC and the 87 recession. The market was cut in half during those periods.So far we havenâ€™t gone close to the losses during those periods. During those periods the markets continued to experience a strong sell off for an extended period, many months of selling not just a couple of weeks.Today the announcement of 14 day isolation on arrival of anyone coming from overseas will essentially wipeout the tourism industry. This paired with the announcement of banning gatherings of 500 or more is going to have an impact on the markets.The problem is this is just the start of it. And there is no end in site.Ill agree on one thing, in a few years the SP should recover but current holders need to stomach some very hard days as more wide spread panic and selling takes control again.
