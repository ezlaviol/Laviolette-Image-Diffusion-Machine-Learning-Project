If you are a sholder of a company focused on Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America, Britain and their neighbours linguistic and Commonwealth will see equities and macroeconomic recovery time soon.

Britain getting out of EU may be seen as the beginning of the global recovery.

Britain, US, Canada and Australasian stocks are now set to take off and left the second tier countries way behind.

Should suit NAB.
