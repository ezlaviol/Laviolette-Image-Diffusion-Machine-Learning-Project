2019-01-08T12:48:00+11:00 : You’ll find those labor MPs all have government defined benefit plans which pay xyz (ie try $200kpa tax free) of their salary indexed for life. 0 risk and doesn’t even matter if the share market went to 0, they get a direct payment from the government. It’s why they equally don’t give a crap about franking credits and double taxation. 

It’s a disgrace.

Meanwhile we have Sarah Hanson young spending almost $1m on travel all billed to the tax payers. They live in an alternative reality.
