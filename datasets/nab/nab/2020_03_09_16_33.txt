When a div is 100% franked then the div you receive is 70% of the gross amount they decree - the other 30% being the tax paid by the coy to the ATO on your behalf. To get back to the full amount it is a matter of 100% divided by 70% which comes out at 1.4285. So an 80c div times 1.4285 is $1.14.  That is the grossed up div. A quick and nasty calc is to halve the div and add it back - eg. 80c + 40c = 120c.
