2019-07-24T21:56:00+10:00 : Sounds easy, perhaps all of the Big 4 banks will be like that. According to the Australian Financial Review, NAB has, unlike ANZ, released its self assessment or report regarding its governance, risk and compliance failings like CBA and WBC and has a lot to deal with the regulator’s issues on those failings.Does Ross McEwan know what he is walking into?According to his Wikipedia entry, on 25 February 2015, Royal Bank of Scotland Group announced that McEwan would forgo a share award worth £1m ($1.25 million USD) saying that he did not want his pay package to "be a distraction from the task of building a great bank". He received £2.7m ($3.37 million USD) despite turning down the award. The announcement came the day before the bank, which was 80% owned by the UK government, was due to release annual results widely expected to be disappointing following a series of fines by banking regulators for failures including for failing to stop manipulation of the FX market.Track record in dealing with governance, risk and compliance failings and regulatory fines not exactly reassuring.You would walk away from RBS Group after all of that? McEwan is a Massey University boy, time to fix up BNZ as well back in NZ or Aotearoa, or whatever they call it now, BNZ is becoming a wee bit uneconomical to pursue because the RBNZ and FMA are all over it.
