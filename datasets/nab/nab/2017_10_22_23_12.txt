2017-10-22T23:12:00+11:00 : The NAB forum here in HC is very interesting because over the last few years the forum has been generally quite busy with lots of chatter despite fairly mediocre share price performance.

Now that NAB has strung together the best 3-6 months of consistent SP growth in recent memory, the forum has gone very quiet.

It's quite unusual, but I'm happy to sit back and not think too much about this one I just hope they keep the DRP in place as it makes this the perfect set & forget.
