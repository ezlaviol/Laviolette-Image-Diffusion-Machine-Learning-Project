Early trials involving Oz scientists as observers will prepare us for a massive launch of confidence as a nation. We can't then lead the world into massive financial success, but can boost the confidence of our own banks & investors. I'd expect to vaccinate the whole country before any other similar country in our trading space. Vaccination will open us to tourism again, & open our Unis, for a start. This is all certainly the basis of our first steps back to normality. I'm tipping a start of vaccination by Xmas.  Further good news would be that a vaccination shot today takes immediate effect from tomorrow. Cheers, Japes
