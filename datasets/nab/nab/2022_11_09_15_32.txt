2022-11-09T15:32:00+11:00 : Press Release: S&PGRBulletin: NAB Can Maintain Robust Earnings09/11/2022  3:08PM  The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings:  SYDNEY (S&P Global Ratings) Nov. 9, 2022--Earnings at National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) should remain robust over the next two years, benefitting from improving interest margins. We view NAB (AA-/Stable/A-1+) as well-positioned to weather future uncertainties, notwithstanding our expectation for lower growth in mortgage lending.  NAB today announced a robust result for the year ended Sept. 30, 2022, with cash earnings from continuing operations up 8.3%. We expect NAB's credit losses to remain low at about 15 basis points in the next two years, in line with those for other major Australian banks. The relatively benign economic outlook, low unemployment, and strong household balance sheets should temper the risks to the Australian banking system from rising inflation, geopolitical uncertainties, and low business and consumer confidence.  We expect the ongoing orderly correction in Australian house prices to continue until mid to late 2023. This should alleviate risks of a sharp fall, and consequent blow to the economy and financial system.  NAB's capital levels should remain strong. Our view incorporates the completion of the remaining A$600 million of a A$2.5 billion buyback announced in March 2022. As of Sept. 30, 2022, NAB's pro forma common equity tier-1 ratio stood at 11.4%, which is well above the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's benchmark of 10.5% for unquestionably strong capital levels.
