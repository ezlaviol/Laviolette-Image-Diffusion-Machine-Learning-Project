I think there are parallels between WOW and NAB.
One point of difference is that NAB seems to be actively working towards a goal.
Not so sure about woolies.
Having said that I did pick up a parcel of WOW at an average of $29.13 or so and am tempted and probably will  pick up more.
However my cost base will still be sub $20.
I guess both stocks are in a sense "recovery" stocks where with more astute management each may possibly bloom.
Both were strong players in the past but maybe the caravan has moved on since those glory days.
Consider the good times under Roger Corbett.
How much of Corbett's success came at the expense of a languid and ailing Coles?
I don't know but maybe the question should be put.
So with NAB.
Can NAB recapture it's once dominant position in business lending or have the dogs barked and the caravan has left town?
Time will tell.
Good Luck,
Cheers,
