I am not as erratic as I sometimes come across. I have been tracking cyb for a while. Off loaded under 4, watched it then climb past 5.5 to get hammered post Brexit. Just took my eye off it today. 
Anyway it's only a flutter of just below 1k shares so it won't break the bank if it goes belly up, but if it goes up to even 4.5 in the next few months it will be a handy little profit.
I saw the others. Ben pulled back ,  though not like the others. I am too heavy in banks for my taste, since caught in by Brexit so no more banks for me, unless they get really really cheap. I will just have to ride the rollercoaster out till I can close some positions.
Waiting.... 
Good value buying at the moment though. 
Wish they would hurry up and decide on the election winner though. My give the market a pep up.
