in your 30's
your laughing........... all the way to the Bank...so to speak 
Hopefully Iâ€™ll be like you........... cannot see any reason why not

myself, I started about 35
and if I can, anybody can   ! 

my thinking is play both games a long term and a specie to generate funds to live and invest in your long terms, be it right or wrong, its produced a solid life style for us

for something after hours, pick up a calculator and start with say, for example just 500 shares and apply a div of only 50 cents twice a year in div reinvest for 30 years........
