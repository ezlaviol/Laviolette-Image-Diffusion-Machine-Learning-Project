2017-08-04T21:52:00+10:00 : I think nab needs to cut dividends and reinvest earnings into technology, systems, people. The core systems are breaking down with regularity and it's costly maintaining legacy systems.  

Historically too much capital is paid out to keep dividends high to satisfy funds and retirees. 

Banks are ultimately a business and the best businesses need freedom to allocate capital as it sees fit rather than conform to wishes of short sighted shareholders. 

Perhaps underwrite a dividend reinvestment every year and pour that money into systems so it can cut its processing  workforce (expenses) but training and retaining high calibre talent.
