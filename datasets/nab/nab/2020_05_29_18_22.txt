2020-05-29T18:22:00+10:00 : My own personal take on what it means1) If you had a small holding you will be allocated the minimum amount (approx $2500)2) If you had a lot of shares you will get the amount you applied for (I assume this would mostly be $30K).3) If you were somewhere in the middle you will be scaled back, and by my calculations it looks like the factor is close to 11%.  I.e. if you had 6000 shares you will be scaled back to 660 new shares (assuming you applied for at least that many).  Lots of assumptions in the above but not long to go before we find out. It is dependent on the participation rate for smaller vs larger shareholdings which we know overall is roughly 1/4.  If it is the same accross all holding sizes the factor could be as high as 28% but I suspect there is less participation at the low end and the high end.As always DYOR
