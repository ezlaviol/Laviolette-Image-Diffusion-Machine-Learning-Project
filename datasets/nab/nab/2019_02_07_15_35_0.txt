2019-02-07T15:35:00+11:00 : Its a sad day when people would vote Bill the dill in. I admit I voted for labor at WA state election, sick of GST share and also old mate Col's spending problem. But given the release of more information I would not go near labor again with a ten foot pole. Id honestly rather Scomo stays in at least im not hearing any policies that are all at the detriment of investment/investors. How does one have growth with all the disincentives labor plan? Why bother investing when you can get handouts seems to be labors new motto. Side note I don't think that NAB would pay out larger dividends to shareholders on the back of a potential change in tax legislation. If it did I assume this would be for non-ordinary share holders so CEOs and the like might get it. Or if they did it might be under DRP?
