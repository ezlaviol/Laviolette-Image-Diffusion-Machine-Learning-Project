2018-11-13T15:20:00+11:00 : Bank shares will rebound in my opinion, in particular NAB as it was hit the hardest:1) The housing market was in part driven by population growth and that hasn't changed.2) APRA news of forcing banks to raise more equity is not so painful.  The banks are not forced to raise more tier 1 capital but tier 2.  This can be done with subordinated debt for example3) Property markets outside of Sydney and Melbourne are rebounding4) The RC penalties will pass over time5) NAB is yielding 11.5% on a gross basis - which is enormous.
