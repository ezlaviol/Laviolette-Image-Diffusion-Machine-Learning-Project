Are banks going to foreclose on residential landlords? in a market falling to the absolute bottom? How that is a positive for banks is beyond me? I think that unless the residential landlords are saved from six months of brutality, the Australian banks will be stuffed completely, not just NIM in the six months, and the lack of security value, but medium and long terms.This is because investment properties will arguably never recover unless there is another political party on the center right such as United Australia or a more moderate version of One Nation to try to save the Australian economy from its nightmarish deterioration of the present.
