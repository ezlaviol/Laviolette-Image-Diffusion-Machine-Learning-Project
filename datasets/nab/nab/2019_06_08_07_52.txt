He has the confidence in making a decision, sees a problem(too much Chinese imports), acts (tariffs) and then starts talks to come to an agreement. It seems to be working to some industries however time will tell whether it is long lasting. I'm not sure that I would describe him as a loser. The US wanted a different type of President and they certainly got that.
