Their is not responsibility of the the ones who are running these banks the one who get the multi multi million salary packages and free options ect.
They seem to be only raking in the money but taking no responsibility of the business and how it is managed.
Not sure why they get these extremely generous salary packages while they do not get the sack and bear responsibility of how the banks have been behaving under their supervision.
It looks and not only looks but they are the untouchables.
So what they do instead they make an agreement to pay out  a large lump sum in the millions of dollars , money that belongs to the share holders.
So now the share holders seem to have to take responsibility of the running of the banks and pay the price and not the bank executives with their mega salaries.
Its a shame this is happening and it undermines our democracy and everything the democracy stands for.
To be honest with you all, its a white wash and should never allowed to happen.
