2020-03-19T14:42:00+11:00 : Hi Up ,I am of the belief , NAB , will need to do some "House Keeping" or will take a lesson from this current trading performance with Nabtrade's  platform !It's nothing but , pathetic !Is it overwhelmed by the Bot's , Algortihims  and the tolerated electronic trading ???I well and truly remember the day about 8 years ago ,  I received a courtesy phone call from Nabtrade , who spoke to me about the Buy Order I had in the system ,          " admittedly"I had it in 3 lots .It was conveyed to me , the ASX took a dim view of this type of  practice !I'm not blind freddy , but , have we an evolved system , that has descended  into the "toothless tiger " syndrome ?P. S  , NAB sends one a sms message , how was my experience at my local branch ? I am not to impressed , when , it rejects my deposit at their ATM in the wall , as they are so focused of promoting this type of banking practice  ! May be some one from NAB , may get the message !!
