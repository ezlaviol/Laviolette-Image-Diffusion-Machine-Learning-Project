So Microsoft, as per your example, did start as a small tech with a future as opposed to a past, as you were eluding too, just like most of the others in the Nasdaq, they didn't just suddenly become blue chip humungous behemoths. They started small with a future performance that has effected nearly every aspect of our lives.  Also, whose to say Aussie techs can't do the same and have a stellar future as you've also alluded too, some look like they could be on the way, the next CSL equivalent maybe, ALU, XRO seem to be making inroads. With NAB it's the opposite, the share price is buggered down 60% over 5 years, paying FF $2 divi a year, but oh hang on a sec not anymore that was then not now, so that negates the great divi argument for them.  Certainly don't think they'll get to $2 yet for a long time, the story ain't good there going forward.Anyway, happy investing.  GLTANABH it's going to be a long haul from here.
