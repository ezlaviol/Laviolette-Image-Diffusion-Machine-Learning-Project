2015-11-12T21:34:00+11:00 : Just asking, but does anyone trade blue chip shares short term?

CBA - you could have bought CBA on Nov 10th for between $73.93 - $74.61. You could have sold today between $75.52 - $77.69
If you bought $100 000 at the very high of $74.61 on the 10th and sold at the very low of $75.52 today you would have made $1220. However, if you bought at the very low of $73.93 on the 10th and sold at the very high of $77.69 today you would have made $5085. So realistically you would have made profit between $1220-$5085

NAB - you could have bought NAB on Nov 10th for between $27.57 - $27.92. You could have sold today between $28.22 - $28.93
If you bought $100 000 at the very high of $27.92 on the 10th and sold at the very low of $28.22 today you would have made $1074. However, if you bought at the very low of $27.57 on the 10th and sold at the very high of $28.93 today you would have made $4932. So realistically you would have made profit between $1074-$4932

ANZ - you could have bought ANZ on Nov 10th for between $25.04 - $25.48. You could have sold today between $26.20 - $26.79
If you bought $100 000 at the very high of $25.48 on the 10th and sold at the very low of $26.20 today you would have made $2825. However, if you bought at the very low of $25.04 on the 10th and sold at the very high of $26.79 today you would have made $6988. So realistically you would have made profit between $2825-$6988

The only concern is if they drop by 1% you do $1000. But after such a big drop from NAB and ANZ going ex-dividend they were a guarantee of going back up, unless the world crapped the bed overnight. 

I find this the easiest way to trade personally if you are very busy, as honestly, your money is pretty safe and even on bad days you will only lose $1000-$2000 if you bought at the wrong time. 

I hope this was okay to put this in here.
