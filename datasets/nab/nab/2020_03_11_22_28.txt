2020-03-11T22:28:00+11:00 : It is the same old play book. The herd are spooked and the panic has set in.They are all yelling SELL SELL SELL. Over the last two years the herd were yelling BUY BUY BUY and criticising people like Warren Buffett for failing to make any significant acquisitions and building up a massive cash hoard of $128 BLN USD.Now Warren is quietly saying BUY BUY BUY, but the herd aren't listening as they stampede for the exits. The Market is already factoring in that things are going to get alot worse economically. As soon as they see the light at the end of the tunnel as they inevitably will, the rebound is going to make those brave souls who listened to Warren alot of money.At the moment I am buying Berkshire Hathaway using the ASX Tracker TCXBRK. Now is the time for Uncle Warren to shine and make his shareholders alot of money buying and making big acquisitions in the modst of the panic, as he so adpetly did in the aftermath of the GFC.
