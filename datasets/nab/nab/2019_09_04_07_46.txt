You are cherry picking issues and circumstance and turning them into Doomsday scenarios without providing any actual analysis
You still have not explained why you are fixated with NAB's exposure to Afterpay. 
It appears you are comparing Corporate lending to bricks and mortar home and small business lending with throw away lines like "unsecured". Do you know the terms of the lending, covenants required or any other relevant requirments? 
To suggest APRA should be involved is mind boggling and shows a distinct lack of understanding of corporate lending.
Just out of interest I had a quick look at the latest Afterpay financials.
As at 30/6/19 Afterpay had a $500m Australian Receivables facility provided by NAB $300m and Citi $200m (Syndicated facilities are common in the Corporate world).
The facility is "Secured" against Afterpay AU Receivables, which are transferred to the facility. (Facility at 30/6/19 was undrawn)
This would be the structure I would expect of a facility for this type of Company and risk is mitigated by the the Banks ability to collect the receivables and no doubt have other reporting covenants.
Obviously any exposure has risks however I cannot see a real specific concern about this lending facility and collapse of Afterpay would see far more pain elsewhere than at NAB and certainly a facility this size does not warrant any regulatory intervention
Analysis of Afterpay financials may raise questions of whether you invest in that Company however do not indicate abnormal risk to NAB (which no doubt NAB's own risk analysis teams have concluded) 
I have no problem if you believe NAB is a sell due to the Macro environment or even NAB internal issues, but basing it on what are not material risks to the balance sheet is just scare mongering. 
Broad sweeping statements leading to specific conclusions is best left to the shock/horror media.........................
