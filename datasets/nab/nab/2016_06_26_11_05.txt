2016-06-26T11:05:00+10:00 : The Dows  "Monster" 600 point loss was actually a fall of 3.39% not much more than our 3.17% drop earlier and FTSE had a late recovery to be only down 3.15%.  Understandably the German and French markets were down more as initial thoughts would suggest they will have to carry a bigger burden in the EU. 
Doubt if our market will be led by Dow as the falls were knee jerk to Brexit.
No doubt will be volatility as everyone tries and work out what this really all means and the cynic in me sees great opportunity for larger funds to create further fear and confusion, so certainly a buyer beware period.
(just remember there has been no fundamental change in anything at yet........................)
