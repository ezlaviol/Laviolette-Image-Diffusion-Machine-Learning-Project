2019-05-04T09:37:00+10:00 : while labor’s policy is designed to put funds in their union backed industry funds and transfer wealth from those who save to those who can’t be $&@“ed, the majority of shareholders are in company structures or higher than 30% rates. So not a drastic effect. still think NAB and ANZ should have bought the dividend forward, however I think it’s to do with politics from labor. They expect them to get in, and given the RC, they don’t want any noise.we lose some FC refunds in the SMSF, however immaterial overall. I’d rsther play the political game and keep socialist labor away from the banks.
