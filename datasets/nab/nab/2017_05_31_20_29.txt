2017-05-31T20:29:00+10:00 : Yesterday's bottoming and recovery of banks was acceptable and normal. But today's further 1.xx% intraday advance was a bit excessive. Can see this on WBC and ANZ long wicks up. Combined with yesterday's reversal, it is too sharply up. So, I expect a red candle and some intraday scare. Then a clear resumption and advance up to at least contact and kiss the 16 day EMA if not the 22 EMA. Then it can go back down and dooms day can happen.

Looking out over the next few months and 2018, I feel a stock market crash coming. Something like August 2011 if not 2008. On a time scale, I think we are in 2007 now with 2008 on its way. I feel the DOW has to go and touch 22,000 first however. Without 22,000 on the DOW, the crash will not unfold. There is some more time left. The DOW has to surge up and the headlines appear "DOW 22,000 all time high".

Then go heavy Gold. Sorry, in fact, accumulate gold now before the coming spike up.

I am sure I will get comments and feedback for this. But hey, this is what the forum is for. Thoughts and ideas.

NAB $30.60.
