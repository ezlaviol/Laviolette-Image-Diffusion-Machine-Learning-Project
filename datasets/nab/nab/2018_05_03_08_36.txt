In the latest move by a bank to cut exposure to wealth, NAB on Thursday said it was looking to sell the businesses by the end of 2019, through a sharemarket float, demerger or possible trade sale. It will keep the JB Were and nabtrade businesses.


I hope its a demerger. Got into NAB before the CYB float. Looks like I might be getting some MLCs soon. Unfortunately ASX:MLC has already been taken. NAB seems to be giving me shares all the time.
