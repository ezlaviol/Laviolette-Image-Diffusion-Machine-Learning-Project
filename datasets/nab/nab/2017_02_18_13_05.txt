TLS has been on a down-swing, is nearing 12 month low share price and dividend is imminent. In fact I think you can still buy now and receive the 15.5c FF divvy or simply wait until she goes ex divvy and probably get them 15-20c cheaper. IMHO this is a great time to buy a yielding stock like TLS provided you take a LT view.

NAB is looking very good but has been on a share price up-swing, so the price is nearing 12 month highs. In my experience this is rarely a good time to buy blue chip stocks, simply because the odds say that a better buying opportunity for NAB will come along in the short-medium term.

Think about Buffet's mantra, ask yourself which one he would lean towards right now. 

You might see other reasons to choose NAB e.g. If you think the banking sector is going to be stronger than telcos, or you think NAB is simply a stronger business model. But... if it's for yield I would be buying TLS right now over NAB.
