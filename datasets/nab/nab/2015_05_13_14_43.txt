2015-05-13T14:43:00+10:00 : TeTeTe, bit of unsolicited advice, quit while you're not too far down, you continue to embarrass yourself!   

Your superficial analysis of where NAB is going is 100% at variance with the market, OMG!

Ripper of a day today, as I said before those lucky enough to get 2 for 15 in the CR are making the easiest money they ever will.  In the meantime, those that think TeTeTe knows anything at all are making SFA!
