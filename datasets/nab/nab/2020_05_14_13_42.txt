2020-05-14T13:42:00+10:00 : A doubt I've had with the big 4 banks for awhile.Do you think the neobanks ING,UP etc will pose a threat to their market share?For example, people in their 20's(myself included) prefer them much over the big4 to bank with in terms of functionality, service and rates.Would this have a long term impact on the prices of banks?
