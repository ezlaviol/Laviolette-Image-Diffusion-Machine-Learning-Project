2020-08-25T17:08:00+10:00 : Interesting mix of views here on where holders of big bank shares are headed, and indeed where we've been.I've held NAB since 2013, and WBC since 2007.  This discussion has caused me to go away and prepare a rough spreadsheet on how at least one of the big banks has actually performed just over the last five years.Let's assume that on 1 July 2015, you had owned $100,000 worth of NAB shares (I calculated that to be 3110 shares based on the intra-day low price of NAB on 01/07/2015 of $32.15 for a total value of $99,986.50. Now let's also assume that you had decided to park your holding in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and walk away, and that your holding did qualify for the 2015 interim dividend paid on 03/07/2015.You would now be the proud owner of 4453 NAB ordinary shares at $18.21 for a total value of $81,089.13.  That's right, you've just spent 5 years and lost nearly a fifth of your outlay, worse in real terms.But don't be too down and out about it though.  When I was doing these calculations earlier, I used last night's close of $17.54, which gave us a value of $78105.62, so you'd be walking around beaming at everyone today, having made over three grand in 24 hours!  Not only that, but you would have another $11.74 carried forward in your participant's plan account, as well as the $13.50 change from your original $100,000.  Happy days!btw My sentiment is 'Hold' because I keep thinking there's light over the hill and around the corner.
