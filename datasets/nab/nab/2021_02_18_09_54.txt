Surely the reduction in brick and mortar and staff costs would offset the cost of a couple of bankers driving around their areas. a lot of people will naturally migrate to online banking anyway, but for the ones who prefer to have a face to talk to it could be a good idea. but then again they probably don't have a lot of competition with brick an mortar anyway, so they're probably unlikely to lose a large customer base either way.
