2020-05-01T17:13:00+10:00 : I won't even bother reading this article giving attention to another CEO who loves the fame of being on the front cover of a magazine. Another reset at NAB?  Another set of scandals at NAB? Another regulatory and capital-related failure at NAB? Another capital raising at NAB? Another blow to the shareholders at NAB? In 1987 Don Argus took NAB overseas and polluted its capital pool by buying up UK and US lenders. For what? The legacy of cumulative failures then passed to Frank Cucuitto, who burnt over $4.5 billion on MLC, a parasite that has clung onto the bank and eroded its overall profit-making ability, and now is a nearly-worthless asset given the changes to the advice model. Then came John Stewart, another poor manager who for god knows what reason decided to expand NAB into South Dakota. How does that make any sense? Then came Cameron Clyne, who bought a heap more wealth management businesses written down to pretty much $0. Then came the Thorburn/Henry era - who at the Royal Commission showed what a laughing stock they were.Throughout all of these CEOs, there have been more "resets" and "restructures" and "changes in direction". McEwan will do nothing but continue the lineage of failures - NAB's share price is at a near 25-year low. Over that period, investors have seen more dilution and more income volatility than any other bank to the extent that the company's total returns at ~5.5%pa have barely been competitive with cash or government bonds.NAB is a cursed bank who seems to fail regardless of who is at the helm. Yet so many investors seem unable to end their obsession with an entity that's only proven over decades to do nothing but disappoint. The only direction McEwan will take NAB is to lower shareholder returns for you.
