I've already read of ways around Shorten's new policy of no tax refunds for franking credits. Basically retirees can use the franking credits from a NAB as an example to offset tax payable on other companies that don't have any franking like property trusts etc.

It will just cause a small readjustment to the portfolio instead of all stocks paying franked dividends.

Personally I think they will dump the policy when they work out how many votes it might cost them.
