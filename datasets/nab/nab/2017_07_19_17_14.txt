2017-07-19T17:14:00+10:00 : I'm not, I am actually underweight financials. I sold 2 properties, 1 in 2016 and 1 recently which means I am flushed with cash and debtless. I poured money in 2016 into BHP and Woodside. Now I still have quite a bit from the sale in 2017, which I've bought more BHP, WPL and WES recently with. Remainder cash going into more financials which I am currently underweight. Was just waiting on confirmation on new rules, and I am glad I did given banks have fallen quite a bit since I had the funds. Patience paid off.
