2019-10-31T06:09:00+11:00 : an increase in dividend is about as likely as an increase in the share price after 10 years... still bear a thought for HSBC shareholders. if u bought this back in 1999 the sp has not moved - that's 20 years. banks need a healthy dividend as often dividends are cut over time, the sp stagnates for a decade, and inflation takes a toll....I am not very positive on banks still l hold em but l watch the exit signs in the building and index funds that actually grow over time.
