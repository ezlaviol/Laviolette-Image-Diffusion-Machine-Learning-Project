2015-11-03T20:15:00+11:00 : Two opposing forces. Lower rates in the short term are good for shareholders with respect to equity returns relative to interest rates but bad for the banks' own returns.

Normally banks seek to offset the loss of interest income on mortgages by cutting rates offered to depositors. Lower interest rates put the banks' interest margins under pressure in a low rate environment as some cash deposit products may already be attracting zero interest rates. When banks pass on a rate cut to borrowers, they cannot fully defray the reduction in interest income as rates on some deposits are already zero and cannot be cut to below zero. I think the recent out of cycle rate increase by WBC was a preemptive move in case the RBA cut rates in November, to preserve its interest margins (and hence dividends), should it have had to pass on the rate cut to borrowers.

For investors on the other hand, lower rates are good because it means the opportunity cost of funding investments in equities is lowered. It makes dividend yield more attractive compared to interest income/expense (whether they are investing savings or borrowing to invest).
