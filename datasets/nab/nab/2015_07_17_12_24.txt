2015-07-17T12:24:00+10:00 : My concern about the idea of applying Negative Gearing for non-investors is the reasoning behind it - and whether that reasoning is consistently applied.  Negative Gearing is allowed for property investors because our tax system allows expenses incurred on income-generating assets to be tax-deductable.  Where those expenses exceed the income generated, it becomes a loss which can be applied to other sources of income.  If you were then to allow Negative Gearing for non-investors, allowing them to claim a deduction against a non-income generating asset (the house), it should logically be applied to all purchases of non-income generating assets - cars, computers, etc - which is done with borrowed money.
I suspect this would have some pretty major implications - lay-bys, pay-day lending, even credit card transactions would all fall under that category.
I'm not suggesting it should or shouldn't be done.  I'm just looking at the possible result of blurring the lines between what is and isn't an 'investment'
