2019-02-08T09:15:00+11:00 : Is not Mike Baird the Premier of the New South Wales State who resigned after governance within greyhound racing and the implosion of his mishandled response to a Greyhound Inquiry?i would have thought Baird was not the sort of person to lead a governance root and branch review.i would have thought you would need someone with great governance credentials.should be a relief rally today otherwise the market has judged that Chronican is not the person for the Chairman job IMHO.CBA’s Livingstone and Comyn, ANZ and Suncorp to follow Thorburn and Henry’s departure IMHO.
