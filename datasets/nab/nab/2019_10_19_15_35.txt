2019-10-19T15:35:00+11:00 : my personal view is NAB dividend will stay the same as prev, @ 83c , basis for this is advertised write downs for this half are in similar range to last half.I am invested long term on a basis of return to higher payout ratio of 99c once "RC writedowns" are reducing AND/OR receive benefit of mlc business change. Good franked dividend also in the interim.
