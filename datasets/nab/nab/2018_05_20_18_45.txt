CSL has always been on high PE ratio, but that hasn't stopped it growing roughly by 5000% over the past 20 something years. 
Has given me far far more than bank shares and I happily continue to hold.
Similarly REA. 
Bank shares will struggle over the next decade and I never buy a share only for dividends.  It must have good prospects for earnings growth. 
By the way, the term "blue chip" is a ridiculous anachronism, when you look at the long term performance of TLS, AMP and NCM it is clear that large size alone does not make a safe investment. 
NST has beaten the pants off NCM as a gold company investment over the past decade.
