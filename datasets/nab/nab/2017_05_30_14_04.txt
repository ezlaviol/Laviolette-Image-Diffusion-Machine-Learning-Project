2017-05-30T14:04:00+10:00 : Seems you like watching the 5 min chart batikit. And yes, it would give you a feel for the intraday mood.

If you do a Fibonacci retracement from last June low to the recent late April high, you get the 61.8% at $27.79.

This is where I think it is headed. This decline in bank shares is comparably to significant 2015 decline in bank shares. The conditions are right for it and even worse. With the government tax, past 1 years (particularly last and more) exuberance in house prices, talk of house price bubbles and general high markets without many corrections and extremely low volatility.

A significant observation is, when the Gillard government came out with the mining tax, it was amazingly right about the time of the mining stock price peak. These governments choose the worst time to introduce a tax. What they do brings on a wobble and marks the peak. I would not be surprised if we just saw bank shares peak and all down from here with a bear market in banks and correction in house prices.

The housing market and therefore banks can get far more nasty from here.  But for now, looking good for a bounce, with yesterday and today being an important day. I wouldn't rule out a some final weakness and a revisit to $29.20's tomorrow though before back to $30.
