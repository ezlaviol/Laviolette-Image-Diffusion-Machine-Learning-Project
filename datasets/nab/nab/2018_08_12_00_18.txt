2018-08-12T00:18:00+10:00 : I wouldn't get too excited about the prospect of tax cuts for the banks. I'm totally against it....Reduce the tax rate to 25% and the banks win and shareholders lose in regards to FF dividends. Imputed credits tax effectiveness reduces and the share holders pick up the tab and pay for the company tax reductions! That ain't a winner at all especially for super funds and SMSF's. Individuals will get smaller tax returns and effectively get caught paying more tax while large corporations that only have to pay a current max of 30% will pay even less while the PAYE people pay up to 47.5% tax. The smart larger corporations bypass the tax laws anyway and won't pay more tax than they need to. Why pay 25% tax if you can pay 1% like Newscorp was rumoured to be doing? Think any large corp is going to turn around and say sure we'll pay 25% when we can pay 1%? The guy on the street is going to get rolled if this goes through parliament so I'm hoping it gets blocked!!! Oh and it sends out such a powerful message to the banks!!! You've all been very naughty and we've discovered this through the RC. Banks cop.....this your punishment is 17 billion dollars worth of tax cuts!!!! Now that sends out a very stern message to the banks...And who's the guy trying to drive through those changes? Oh Malcolm an ex banker of course, looking after his own and swindling the electorate who haven't thought through how those changes will impact individuals....
