2016-05-21T14:28:00+10:00 : NAB weekly showing positive signals ex div.
SP above EMA(50) which is also above EMA(100)
I'm using the weekly to remove trading noise on the day traded ex-dividend.
The weekly volume would be down on the past two bars if you remove the huge spike when it traded ex div.
(Falling price on falling volume, shows support and therefore recent uptrend remains intact)
Happy to hold and participate in DRP, the company is doing great following Clydesdale demerger IMO.

All my opinion only, happy to hear feedback on those points.
