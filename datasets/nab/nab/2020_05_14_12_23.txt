It makes it easy for you to see the trend and it gives you an insight into the near term previous momentum of the market and volatility, important things if you are trading or trying to fine tune your investment entry price.As far as long term future forecasts, not so useful.Combining basic charting theory with sound fundamentals and economic analysis is a good way to go, IMO.
