2017-05-29T14:55:00+10:00 : Fund managers haven't pressed the button yet. Sill trying to squeeze more meat out of it on the downside. Once they decide to let it go up, the bounce will be quick. I'm saying $30.60 conservative but can easily overshoot to the upside ($31) just as it is to the downside.

Notice the chart gap between $29.08 - $29.28 from 8 December. So near it but not filling it yet. Bullish sign when it gets near but doesn't fill it like that.
