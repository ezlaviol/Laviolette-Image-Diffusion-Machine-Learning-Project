At $4.5 billion some analysts think it's paid too much, but as Narelle Hooper reports, it's all about moving the big banks beyond Australia's small domestic market and away from their traditional retail banking services - current value would be around 800million - they completely missed the smsf boom which ironically Nab redstar has gained in - now is that a win hmm not sure ... feels like this nab thread has been starved of posters... anyway cp happy hour is here
