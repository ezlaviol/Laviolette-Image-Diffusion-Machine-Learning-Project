2020-04-25T14:21:00+10:00 : The search for a cure might be a side issue.  Reversing the lockdown and accepting some consequences is the main job ahead.Sweden's approach is based on protecting the vulnerable, flatening the curve to ease pressure on the health system but assumes no cure and that the virus is only as deadly as a very bad flu.  They expect that a year from now most countries will have a similar level of deaths per head of population adjusted for demographics (high impact on aged). Their view is also that countries who have put off the spread by severe lock downs or good fortune have just put off the pain and may struggle to step back from lock down because expectations are too high.  In Australia at the moment leading news stories are of "a 90 year old man has died in xxxxx and an 86 year old in yyyyyy".  Ministers are very seriously announcing such events to packed news conferences.  How do we step back from that and accept that a lot of very old and sick people will die over the next 12 months if we start up the economy again?Evidence is building of a death rate of about 0.5 % once hidden spread in counted.  Perhaps 5 x worse than a bad flu season - a tough year for many but not armageddon.
