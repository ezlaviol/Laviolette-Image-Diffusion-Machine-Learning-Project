2023-11-05T16:45:00+11:00 : Do you think NAB will be allowed to take over the undercapitalised in solvency strife Macquarie Group after MQG’s poor results on Friday?ANZ would be the better choice given NAB’s recent problems, CBA would be too politically problematic.NAB is cleaner than Cronywealth and Paedopac Bank but not by much, so I think ANZ would get Macquarie if there is the expected fire sale.
