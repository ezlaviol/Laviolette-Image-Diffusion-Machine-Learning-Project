If they had stayed the market would have seen that as very negative.
The fact they have walked gives the market more certainty than if they had stayed.

I bought into Nab a few days ago purely on the assumption that they would walk and the market would see that as positive.
It will be interesting to see how the market reacts but I would not be surprised to see the stock rally.
