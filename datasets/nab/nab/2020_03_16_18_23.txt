I have not heard any decent report on how people have survived the virus - just the relatively small number (mostly aged or already ill) of people who have died. Media treating it like a football score.We've been told at work to get ready to work from home and they expect a 75% drop in productivity. There have been no cases in the entire building but the panic is there.PS: does anyone know where to source dunny paper? Seems that every time I walk in a shop I just can't get any because some idiots are hoarding and putting their kids out to grannies place to make room for it. It could try overseas but travel bans are now in place.
