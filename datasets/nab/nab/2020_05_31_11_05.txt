Ie other shares or even selling real property such as land, a house etc.I wouldn’t be selling the stock at a gfc low... it should recover as we saw in the last week it can whipsaw back. When the economy comes back it’ll recover. Just don’t expect it overnight.nothing is fundamentally wrong with the big 4 banks, we’ve just experienced the RBC/scandals and now this. Perfect storm. I’d argue they are a buy.
