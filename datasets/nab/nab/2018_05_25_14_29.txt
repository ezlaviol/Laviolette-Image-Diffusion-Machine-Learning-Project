First article I have read in mainstream media that doesn't hammer those "greedy" banks for a while. 

How many of us that have bought real estate and/or cars paid cash and didn't have to borrow from a bank? Not I, unfortunately, but good luck to those who don't need their services. 

Oh well, back to watching the show. NAB at 24 or over 30, I know what I am doing either way, so I will not really mind either way.
