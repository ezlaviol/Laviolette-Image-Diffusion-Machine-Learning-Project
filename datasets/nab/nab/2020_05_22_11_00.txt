2020-05-22T11:00:00+10:00 : if I only paid $29,715 which is 2100 shares at $14.15, would that be rejected because it is not one of the amounts clearly stipulated in the offer ?It is customary to pay amount that is exactly equal to x shares at the offer price.Maybe because the price under this offer can vary.   Except of course the price won't vary now, It will be $14.15  being the lower of the 2 prices offered.
