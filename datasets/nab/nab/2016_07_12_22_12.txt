For some long term investors those record numbers mean record profits and if I was concerned about anything right now it is not that we will have some supersonic bubble burst, but simply that record highs mean record profits and smart people take record profits when they can. I'd guesstimate that some serious profit taking is about to commence, the media will interpret it as a sell off and commodities will rise on the fear. Since you like to guesstimate and I've had some exceptionally good fortified wine  I'll have a stab. You might get those closing positions yr looking for  Good luck !
