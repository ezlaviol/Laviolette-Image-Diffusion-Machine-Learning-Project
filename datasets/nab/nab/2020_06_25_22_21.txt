2020-06-25T22:21:00+10:00 : I got burnt badly after GFC... During GFC, after first round of selling I thought stocks are cheap and I jumped on...Few months later, bank sold everything (margin lending), I was left empty handed. I lost my entire life saving...This recovery is short. Last few days market actions, it was clear that it was a Suckers Rally (when INSTO dumps and mum and dad buys)
