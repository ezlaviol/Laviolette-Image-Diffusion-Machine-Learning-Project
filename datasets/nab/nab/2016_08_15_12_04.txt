Michael McCormack as small business minister is so competent in running the Census and other things that small business in Australia has an existential problem. Perhaps it might come back after 3 years or whenever the National Socialists like McCormack are no longer the Government by either the Liberals who get over their shotgun marriage to the National Socialists or another election lets them govern in their own right or with Labor whichever is the sooner.

NAB should lend to big business to be more profitable IMHO. AGL, ORG, CTX, TLS, BSL, LLC, TCL, WES, WOW and the other banks are bound to get bigger with small business so much poorer.

Duopolistic theory works whatever the politics but especially when Government failure is so high.
