2020-11-12T10:20:00+11:00 : Nov 12 (Reuters) - Australia's prudential regulator said on Thursday it was looking to revise some terms on executive pay policies of the country's large banks, retirement funds and insurers it proposed last year after the fallout from a government-backed inquiry.  	The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said it plans to reduce the minimum deferral period for chief executives' variable long-term bonuses to six years, compared with seven years it had proposed earlier.

The APRA had set out its initial proposed new remuneration rules in July last year in the aftermath of a Royal Commission into the financial sector in 2018 that blamed flawed incentives for widespread wrongdoing in the industry.
