2021-09-15T12:11:00+10:00 : You're being harsh nonetheless.I have a watchlist with all the major banks and a few other finance type stocks.  The SP performance charts are quite instructive, with virtually all of the nine showing a growth pattern through that fist half of August, and ANZ, CBA, MQG & NAB hitting 6 month highs, but only MQG and NAB have retained those gains, and remain the standouts.I'm disappointed to hear about corporate hubris anywhere .... I doubt we can change much there from where we sit, but boards are becoming more diverse, and ethics committees are more active I think.  In the meantime, I'm happy with NAB's performance, and of the big institutions, CBA (which I also hold) and MQG look very expensive, WBC (also held, but maybe not for long) seem to have developed a habit of stepping in dog poo, so I'm sticking with NAB.
