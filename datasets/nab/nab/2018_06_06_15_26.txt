Please consider the following: NAB and WBC almost collapsed in the GFC. The US Treasury bailed them out and the Australian Government backed their customers withdrawals. This goes back to my first point about the too big to fail argument.

If you think issues in retail and criminal syndicate will cause a collapse id say that its likely you will be wrong. If you think the share price will fall much further that's your opinion and your entitled to it. Have a look at HSBC if you think crime will deter a bank. They have almost a massive criminal issue every decade including money laundering and other criminal syndicate activity.

The collapse of a bank will effect the economy, a ton of shareholders, a ton of employees. It simply will not happen unless a banks board has been blatantly ignorant.

So look at the Share Price after the GFC. 3-4years and it was back above where it left off. The economy and RC issues are short sighted my friend. Give it 4-5 years and see where NAB are.
