2020-03-14T18:28:00+11:00 : Equaliser, well put, I noticed as soon as your post went in the “monsters” tried to drown you out by posting as “would be doctors and caronavirus expert's”  if anyone reads Equaliser’s post today and it’s followed by trolls calling $15 NAB share price, then you know who is a shorter posting. No one that holds NAB stock will be negative. So any negativity will be by the shorts who are going to get their arses burnt off next week. This is my first post on NAB and must say a lot of children seem be posting or naive adults. What’s the point of discussing a virus on HC. Go to a medical forum and tell them.  Ffs.
