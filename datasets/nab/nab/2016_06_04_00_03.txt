2016-06-04T00:03:00+10:00 : Yes, I am positive towards NAB going back to $33 soon.

The non-farm payroll figure released this morning was very bad, worst in five years but for NAB, it means that FED interest rates will be held by Yellen and the Governors. With unemployment only reducing due to workers giving up search, you would have to think the next measure might be stimulus, good for NAB.

Good for NAB on wholesale funding basis, good for AUD against USD and Euro/ GBP IMHO but pls DYOR.
It might retrace to low $26s but as interest rate rises in US go off the cards, equities will go up again as will NAB back to above $30.
