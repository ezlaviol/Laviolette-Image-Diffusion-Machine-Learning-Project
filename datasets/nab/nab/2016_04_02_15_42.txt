Yeah, there looks like enough skittishness in the market that sub 24 feels like a reasonable possibility. Plugging the numbers into an option pricing calculator, I read the result as there being a 15% chance it will *finish* the end of April under 24, but I'm just using a rough rule of thumb for probability calculation (the delta of an option). 

I don't think it tells us the probability of it being at 24 or below *any time* in the next month.
