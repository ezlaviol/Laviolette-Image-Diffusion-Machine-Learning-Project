2022-10-13T08:57:00+11:00 : i guess NAB paying 10%+ divs for some time didn't really help growth eitherbut that's besides the point. like you say it's mindset, vision, leadership right.. I don't really see anything different with NAB, or ANZ WBC in that area . always trailing.. keeping head above water.CBA still leading the way with innovation, new tech adoption.. even their security awareness email was very impressive compared to its peers following the Optus mess.with CommSec. As i have said to nabTrade many times.. STOP trying to reinvent the wheel! look at CommSec, there's your benchmark..reach it atleast :-[that's also why i call NAB a yoyo stock..buy the lows, sell the highs, be patient, repeat.. because t isn't going to skyrocket
