But the market thinks the NAB offer will attract less in part because Ramsay has been a glamour stock for some time and is a newer company compared to NAB.That said, the latest broker reports show eight banks had a buy on NAB compared to six for ANZ and just two and three for Westpac and CBA respectively.If 25 per cent of the NAB register put its hand up for the full stock issue this would raise $4.2 billion or more than eight times the $500 million planned.At $15.67 a share, the stock is trading at a premium to the issue price.We can assume that more shareholders wanted shares than NAB have allocated and why wouldn’t you if you had the spare cash.The bank is back on the broker buy list, is trading at a premium to the offer price and under new boss Ros McEwan the bank looks set to handle the tough conditions ahead.It all depends on how many shares Chronican and his will allocate.For that answer we will have yo wait until Wednesday but shareholder advocate Stephen Mayne is ready to jump if the NAB board duds its shareholders yet again.
