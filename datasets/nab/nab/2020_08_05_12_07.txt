2020-08-05T12:07:00+10:00 : You don't have to ramp, this is a stock that trades millions of dollars worth of volume every day.At the moment the can is getting kicked well and truly down the road. At some point the kicking will stop, job keeper and seeker will be wound back, the effect of Vic and potential similar lockdowns in other states to be felt...then you can tell if its a great buying opportunity.
