I think people will sell slowly, pump for the next two months, knowing a sell off is coming, and then with the net result, that the next crash doesnt go from here to a low number, but rather higher from here, to a number not far off where we are at.The share price just cannot fall that far based on fundamentals and if it does there will be nowhere to hide from anyone.
