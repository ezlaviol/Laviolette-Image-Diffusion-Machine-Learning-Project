On Jan 4, a big glitch happened to NABTRADE online system. Although there was enough credit like ten thousand dollars in my cash account, it always showed negative equity! My money could not be used at all and I missed a lot of opportunities, in particular the same day, pot stocks prices were soaring heavily after Health minister announced the Approval of cannabis medicine export. I had to call nabtrade hotline for help and waited in a 30 mins queue! Then I was told it was a disaster across the whole system! A lady put the order manually over the phone. But could not make any change in the platform by myself if I had not transferred enough new money in from other accounts. I lodged a complaint, but Nabtrade rejected any decent compensation after 2 week so-called investigation. Only offered me 5 trading for free. What a joke! If i had been able to use my money, I could have earned ten thousand bucks! I will talk to My solicitor about seeking compensation. Shame on you, Nabtrade!
