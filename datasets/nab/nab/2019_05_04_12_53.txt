If this happened in Africa there would be riots and protests."Is it NAB's fault that the housing market is going down, bad debts are rising and competition between banks is going up? Because those are some of the factors NAB's board has to take into account when deciding whether or not to cut the dividend. I'm a NAB holder and I don't blame the bank one bit for cutting the dividend. I invested knowing that, along with the super high dividend yield came extra risks, such as house prices collapsing. If the economy tanks in the coming years and NAB cuts its dividend even further, I won't blame anyone but myself because no one forced me to buy bank shares and assume the heightened risks that come with it.
