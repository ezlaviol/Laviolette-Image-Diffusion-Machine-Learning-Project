Sorry Kas, we don't need to throw the baby out with the bath water! LNP please. You know bank shares will be cheap at some stage anyway. Next week is a double top for me. NBN connected on Monday, nab divs on Tuesday. Still undecided whether or not to load up CBA a month out from results. I really think they will cut back on the div this time and I don't think the market will like it. That's just what I think anyway. Crystal ball has been broken since I bought it off that Demtel tv show.
