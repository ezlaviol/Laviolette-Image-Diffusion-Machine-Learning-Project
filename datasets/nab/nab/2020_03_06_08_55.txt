Was a Thorburn friend and personal pick and things have changed. 
I never like these type of appointments and placing them in jobs where they have no experience (such as head of retail) just as a means to an end
Don't see it is any issue for NAB and I am sure Baird will find another path to a CEO type role he is seeking.
