IMO we have had a sell down for profit on brexit fear, a non brexit for market gain and before the vote we will have another fear + gain scenario. Another 4 days for for institutions to pull and sway market emotion for profit. I get tired trying to follow the market sway but if I miss a bump or two it's irrelevant as their are always bumps in the road ahead.
