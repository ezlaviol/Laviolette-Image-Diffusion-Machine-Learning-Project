2018-04-25T14:53:00+10:00 : No link to any article confirming brokers are not wanted anymore - just a hypothesis on my part, seeing so many complaints abt brokers, and then the RC 'hammering-in',....

I suspect, there is still the risk of any bank being hammered too low by the RC investigations, may not be able to recover to the full-glory days anymore.

I'm still holding, have no intention to cutloss,....
