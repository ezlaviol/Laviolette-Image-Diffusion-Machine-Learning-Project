2020-04-27T11:15:00+10:00 : Yep, looks like I have some awesome bank losses to realise this year at tax time, all thanks to the pseudo pandemic and the tiny RONA recession we had to have (thanks to non democratic IMF mandatory citizen funded  loan books, engineered  big pharma sales and a virus that the actual evidence suggests is on par with an average flu season). Now need to go to beach to recover and de stress, oh that’s right they shut those down too because “science”  Bring on the cocktails hmmm margarita, monitov? only  as It’s a social distancing thingy lol.This does not constitute financial advice, also squirrels don’t drink...  enjoy day and best don’t buy in a hurry.
