It appears you cannot understand Therefore unless you give a sincere apology you are not worth reading any of your future comments .Instead of calling someone a liar, you should have asked how is it possible or explain further my comment.Think for a moment someone invested in 3 houses as long term investment then real estate drops should he/she sell to buy some back later? Better buy a 4th one when price down. Same for share investments some are for very short term and others are held for very long term, may be to hard for you to fathom. Sorry poor mike999 you have to do better to impress.
