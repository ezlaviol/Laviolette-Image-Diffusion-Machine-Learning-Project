Not a day goes by that I don't reflect on my error in not buying more CBA after the GFC and since. CBA has flogged the other banks since then (although WBC is respectable) and my value-investing nature keeps bringing me back to NAB but sooner or later I might have to acknowledge that NAB is not "value" compared to CBA it is simply a dog by comparison and maybe it's time to just funnel more money into the Rolls Royce of bank stocks instead of going heavier on the Kia.
