If the CBA cuts I think that may be an indicator that others will follow except ANZ ofc which has already indicated it expects to maintain at least the same 80c as previous. If NAB maintains 90c then it's as good as it is at the previous 99c to me. If not then things have changed a lot since the last results and might itself trading around the same levels as ANZ like it used to. Big gap from NAB to WBC considering NAB "had" a higher return. CBA still by far the strongest and first to turn to a positive but geez it's a big price to pay.
