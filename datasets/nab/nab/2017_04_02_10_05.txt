2017-04-02T10:05:00+10:00 : Good little write up. I said last year they were a buy,and they are now up almost 20%

I thought the reason for the move up was somewhat because of the great Bond Yield trade unwinding and rates o/s increasing, but I suspect this gap to continue as NAB will more than likely issue new securities and buy these back as they will effectively depreciate by 10% each year till 0 in 2022

From AFR a couple of years ago...

In 2012 the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority agreed on a phase-out process, whereby each bank is permitted to reduce its capital measurement of ineligible securities by 10 per cent a year. By January 1, 2022, the weighting of these securities falls to zero
