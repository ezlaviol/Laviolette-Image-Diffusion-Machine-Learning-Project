Topped up ANZ and BOQ. NAB didn't move enough, it's only 30c under my entry so hardly worth buying for that. Bit of a red day across the board. Profit taking on pls I see. Always good buying on a red day . RBA expected to hold, don't know whether that will be good or bad, most economists are predicting a cut next month and we now have the prospect of losing our AAA rating if we don't start to show some economic effort to get debt under control. Good news for bargain hunting but more so a good reason to have money sitting out.
