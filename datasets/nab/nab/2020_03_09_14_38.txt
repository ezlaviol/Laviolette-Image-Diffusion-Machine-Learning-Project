2020-03-09T14:38:00+11:00 : You may be right @@crosek . I am holding off buying today - purely as I really have no idea why the ASX fell by so much today. I want to see what the DOW does overnight. Either will bounce back a bit or it will fall again. If the ASX does not bounce tomorrow and continues to fall then the NAB SP could go down a bit more.While NAB fell to $17 during the GFC, it may hold at or above $20 this time around. Any fall tomorrow will see me buying in. Plus, if the trend is upwards then it won't be that great tomorrow.In any case, anyone buying in at current prices is making a clever investment choice.

Can I ask a silly question... What is the thinking behind buying when the price is falling? Is it cheap or just low priced? During the GFC the peak was at Nov 07 and it only found its bottom in Jan 09, I don't think we are anywhere near the bottom just based on that the huge volatility has already done damage throughout the whole market.
