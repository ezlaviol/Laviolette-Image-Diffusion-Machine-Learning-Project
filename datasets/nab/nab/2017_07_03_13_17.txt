Compare it to your Yahoo chart - it is quite obviously wrong. Actually don't even have to look at the Yahoo chart. The prices you quoted for different periods made it easy to know you had the wrong info - ie - High prior to GFC followed by low not shown correctly on the Yahoo chart????

Not really sure what you are actually looking at on your chart - have you done any training on charting? If so you should be looking at proper software, but remember the old saying "a little information can be a dangerous thing"

If you are only after prices on particular dates then as I said, the ASX site may have enough info...............

ps - CYB sale was worth about $1 per share to holders IIRC. Refer to anns for finer details / dates etc.
