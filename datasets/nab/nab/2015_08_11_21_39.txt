2015-08-11T21:39:00+10:00 : Boondog here are my thoughts.

Yesterday's Q3 profit was a surprise.
Today's sell off was a shock.

I still believe that NAB is the best placed of the Big 4.
I would expect a decent bounce from here. If we have another lousy day tomorrow I'll put my money where my mouth is and hit the buy button.
