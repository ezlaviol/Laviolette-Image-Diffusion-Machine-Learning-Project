2018-12-05T12:33:00+11:00 : From news.com."A day after global stocks rallied on a weekend US-China announcement suspending new tariffs, global markets mostly pulled back as investor focus shifted to the murkiness over what was agreed to and the difficulty reaching resolution to disputes on thorny matters such as intellectual property.“People are starting to dissect the reality to the tariff agreement,” said Manulife AM Senior Portfolio Manager Nate Thooft.US President Donald Trump appeared to be back in fighting mode after the weekend show of comity, saying he would “happily” sign a “fair” deal with China but was also ready to take a harder line.“I am a Tariff Man,” Trump said on Twitter. “When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN.”Someone needs to break Trump's Tweeting finger IMO.
