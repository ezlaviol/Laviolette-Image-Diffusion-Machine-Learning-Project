2017-11-06T22:01:00+11:00 : as per what gindalan said, resources, I don't want to cross promote but specifically fmg, I think the divvy will be great in feb/mar and the divvy rally leading up to it will provide some decent capital growth as well.

I feel rio and bhp are a bit toppy atm and fmg are lagging, so we may see a good rotation of funds into fmg in the short term.

however like I said if nab gets close to 28, I will certainly consider selling some put options on it, as it will be good value around there.
