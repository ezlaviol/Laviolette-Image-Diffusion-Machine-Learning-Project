You have made a good case without the DEFINATE price predictions of others.My issue is with those that make predictions with extreme prices, both up and down( those with "it's going to the moon" garbage are just as bad) can influence inexperienced investors and cause them to make poor decisions.If somebody inexperienced takes the posters advice that NAB is going to $8 and sells then the market turns before that and runs hard (and it might) they have been disadvanged financially.Without trying to sound like a w...er I have eeconomics quals and was a stockbroker in a previous  life and I readily admit I have no certainty in where this current correction will take us. I am certain there will be continuing volatility but at some  point a catalyst will provide a turning point.
