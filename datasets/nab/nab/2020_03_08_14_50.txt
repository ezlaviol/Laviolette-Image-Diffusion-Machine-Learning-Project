2020-03-08T14:50:00+11:00 : A very clever friend of mine - a scientist - came up with a comment that was very incisive If you look at the figures for the coronavirus, something stands out very clearly. In a contagion, infections grow exponentially. That is not happening.The growth is linear. That could mean that containment measures are actually working to slow infections down or that the virus is not as bad for most people (symptoms are non-existent or minor and are therefore not detectable).Interesting aspect of the disease.I think (media driven) that there is a lot of irrational behaviour spreading and that sort of blurs any logic being applied.In any case, it is opening up opportunities for those not paralysed by fear.
