2018-11-16T11:10:00+11:00 : IMO given profits are expected to be flat to declining in the next few years the current div is probably unsustainable. 2018 div was 95% payout ratio, prior year was 80% payout. Assuming 80% payout on current profit would result in a div around 168c. At current share price that is still around 7% ff yield.Allowing for a 5% slide in eps from 210cps to 200 cps and 80% payout ratio would result in a div of around 160cps - the same as ANZ. That is still roughly 6.7% yield at current prices. Not to say that things won't get worse than that, but you would have to say a lot of bad news is already built into the share price and crystal balling future divs still gives a healthy yield - fully franked as well.Will continueÂ to add.
