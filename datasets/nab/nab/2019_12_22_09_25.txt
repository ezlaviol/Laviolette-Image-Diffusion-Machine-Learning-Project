In 10 or 15 years time, we will enter an era of a cashless society. No ATMS - so it will be interesting  to see whether that increases branch patronage or reduces it.The upside of that for banks is that it will cust costs considerably so maybe keeping branches open will not be such a burden.

How many people still use branches for their banking these days?Is that the most cost-effective way to serve customers in 2020?
