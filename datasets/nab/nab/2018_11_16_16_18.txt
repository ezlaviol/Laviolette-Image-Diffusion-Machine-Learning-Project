Regardless of the term though, a falling share price is supply vs demand where there is low demand and high supply forcing down sale price of shares. As such there is more people trying to sell shares and getting a lower price for them. They are getting out because divy has came and gone and now want to see how the market goes over the next few months, or take the cash and try get a better return elsewhere. At least this is my opinion. The share price is horrible atm, significantly undervalued though but I see it falling further before a correction IMO.
