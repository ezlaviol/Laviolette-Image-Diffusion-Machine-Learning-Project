2020-06-25T10:37:00+10:00 : Hi, I bought 12,000 at $15.xx in May sold at $19.xx in June. waiting for $16.74 to buy 12,000 shares back to lower my average price (after profit) to $11.xx. I only trade NAB short term highs and lows in my portfolio because they have no debt, are a big four bank, we are going through a gfc like scenario which won't end as long as covid destroys jobs and interest rates remain low. I would ignore me too if I was holding NAB shares when the SP is about to get smashed and I was holding.
