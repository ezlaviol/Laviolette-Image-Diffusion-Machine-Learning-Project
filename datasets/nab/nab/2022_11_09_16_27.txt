2022-11-09T16:27:00+11:00 : So these nostradamic shorters have struck again.I just did a quick analysis of the NAB SP over the last 3 months:• The average intra-day movement was 1.11% (that surprised me)• There were 28 days with SP movement of 1% or more [13 down and 15 up]• There were actually 10 days with a SP movement of >1.7%Now, if we buy on all the down days and sell on all the up days:- we could make a squillion- and if we knew the intra-day movements, the world is our oyster!At least we can rest easy in the knowledge that there will be no shorters left in a few months- they'll all be retired!
