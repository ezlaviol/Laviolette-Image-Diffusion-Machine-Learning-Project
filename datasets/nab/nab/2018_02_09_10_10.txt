2018-02-09T10:10:00+11:00 : Another good opportunity to buy NAB today for the 7% fully franked yield. Particularly after a positive quarterly profit announcement yesterday which was received well by the market.

Personally I am happy to see the recent corrections in the US market. Their market can't keep moving up on a daily basis forever. I much prefer to see 4% corrections than a 10% + crash. A bit of a reality check. On the positive side, IMO Aussie market is now undervalued and great time to be buying bank stocks for yield and their relatively safe profits.
