2017-09-05T18:35:00+10:00 : Be careful assuming that NAB is "better" than CBA. History shows that except for very brief periods of time (like the last few weeks) CBA has been a much, much better investment choice.

It's easy to prefer NAB right now and fair enough but CBA is the one (eventually) more likely to rebound and outperform once these issues are resolved.

I'm buying CBA in small parcels right now, not NAB.
