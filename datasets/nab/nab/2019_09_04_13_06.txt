2019-09-04T13:06:00+10:00 : Imo all banks are going to have trouble finding growth, however my mention of NAB and AfterPay relate to NAB previously having explosive growth when they took over control of Custom Credit whereas in this case they don't own AfterPay but are providing $300 Million funding for little return for the associated risks when if the AfterPay business was really profitable then they should be owning it NOT funding it. When NAB purchased Custom Credit they controlled and benefits from the huge profits for many years but AfterPay has not yet proven it can make money and they lending to it to tune of $300 million seems strange imo. My comments about APRA are relevant because they are responsible for limiting people wanting to buy into better security than AfterPay type assets yet APRA not commenting on NAB lending on AfterPay receivables of a lesser security value than bricks and mortar. APRA is turning a blind eye to a higher risk "security" but going hard against house lending. Why ?
