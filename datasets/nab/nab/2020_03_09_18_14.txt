2020-03-09T18:14:00+11:00 : The China "traditional" factories/offices shutdown starts just before Chinese New Year ie: 25th Jan and will last for at least 2 weeks. It so happened COVID-19 numbers started to escalate around that time.....me thinks if it has not been CNY time, the economic impact may even be greater.
