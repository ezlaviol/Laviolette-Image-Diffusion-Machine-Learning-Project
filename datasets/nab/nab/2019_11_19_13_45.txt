The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), which supervises the banking sector, said BNZ, whose parent company is National Australia Bank Ltd  (NAB) , had made three capital calculation errors.  	"It is now required to increase the risk weight floor of its operational risk capital model from $350 million to $600 million capital," the RBNZ said in a statement.
