2018-12-21T15:42:00+11:00 : NAB is currently paying a 12.2% div on a FF basis. To fall to $20 would raise the current yield to over 14% on a FF basis. They can cut the dividend by 25% and it would still be yielding over 9% (FF) at the current price.

During the GFC they cut the div by 26% but the prior 2 years had raised dividends by large amounts.
Are current conditions worse that the GFC?? I don't think so, nor has NAB been raising divs over the last couple of years.

How's the economy? Govt talking SURPLUS!! Compared to just about everywhere else we are indeed the lucky country. Why on earth would banks like this, that have gone sideways for 20 years go to new lows now??

How come everyone gets bullish when the SP goes to $34/sh but bearish at $23?? Common sense seems to be very uncommon!!
