I've seen a ton of write ups in the last few years saying there's a good chance with Basel requirements that these securities are no longer Tier 1 and need to be replaced, hence rebought at their original value @ $100. I would have thought with the recent rights issue there was a chance this could happen... Whats the i rate going forward now, 4-5%??
