2020-08-26T19:44:00+10:00 : Unless of course crypto currency or some other form of cashless society becomes the norm I borrowed money recently to purchase a property. I certainly didn't go with one of the big four. They just couldnt compete with the non bank lenders on rates and fees.Likewise, if i was in the market for a new car, would I go to a big bank for a car loan, or would I go to the dealer and walk out with a new car at 1% finance over 4 years?If I'm short of cash and my refrigerator blows up, will I put it on my CC, potentially incurring 18% interest, or do i use one of the BNPL platforms? if I'm late with a payment, the fees are still significantly lower than CC fees.The big banks no longer have the monopoly on retail credit and they dont even have the monopoly on funding for non bank lenders. Really, aside from those dumb enough not to, or are too lazy to shop around, why would anyone use a big bank product atm?Lean and mean is the answer in a deregulated, hyper competitive, global credit market.The big banks are overweight dinosaurs that will either need to trim down or perish.The days of big banks being viewed as 'blue chip' investments is well and truly over imo.Now, if the property market does crash in Australia, all hell will break loose with the big 4. The signs are already starting to appear. Watch the mortgagee sales numbers in 6 months time.. The banks can only hold off for so long..Tick, tick, tick..
