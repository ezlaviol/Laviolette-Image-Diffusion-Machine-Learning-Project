2016-06-18T14:28:00+10:00 : Be very careful with your assumptions; NAB is not ex divvy, there is another due Sept 1st and your $24 target is highly likely to be hit when she goes at that time.

Review the recent divvy announcements; will the divvy be reduced? Will the yield hold up? Will the market be moving money into NAB or will it see reduced divvies as a reason to move it out?

Be careful.
