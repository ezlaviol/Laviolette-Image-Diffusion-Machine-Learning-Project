I cannot grasp why one would continue to bombard a forum negatively on a stock they think is horrible. Most people that don't like something move on from it to something they do like.

In response to your points.

1) Major multinational banks will fill the void - Yes but this is not the collapse of the banks. This is simply a replacement of a non-successful bank with a successful one. So your not really justifying any valid argument against the too big to fail theory. As I said while it is a theory, its been around long enough and supported long enough I consider it almost a certainty theory or in a sense what a scientist would deem "Fact" enough not for it to be viewed differently (as pointed out by Savy a blindspot none the less but what keeps them going).

2) Bankers don't get long jail sentences for a number of reasons 1 - the board act on behalf of a company and as such can only be looked at on an "employee" or "directors" basis. As such unless the justice system can pin something criminal on them personally its the bank as a company that will be sued for its behaviour and not the person directly. Again id go advise to watch a documentary on HSBC you will see what I am talking about. The UK government fined the bank in the past for criminal activity. The board passed it onto  1) customers or 2) shareholders. They got away unscathed, history has a funny way of repeating itself. Alternatively to this they just quit (CBA CEO) before it really takes off.

3) The RC will allow for a change in banking policy and yes this will have some impact on profit margins, but when you have paid for a house/business with bank money, and you are receiving continued interest income you will make money none the less....
