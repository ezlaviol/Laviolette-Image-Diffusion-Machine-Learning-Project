2021-11-09T17:03:00+11:00 : Nice to see the divvy increased, final dividend of 67¢ per share, up from 30¢ paid last year. It is a solid full year result with a cherry on top of a 14.2 per cent uptick in agricultural business loans. Nice to see NAB strengthen that NAB niche further...Still a hold for me though. Content with the NAB sizing in the portfolio, it's a divvy play for someone with a low enough average like I do. Around 3% divvy is not much of a carrot at this point to make it a buy. That is a worse yield than capital heavy mid-tier miners in the ASX. Not really expecting much growth from here on but will be a welcome surprise if it does happen. Smaller more nimble outfits like PPM, JDO, HUB and LFG would be the way to go if one is expecting growth in the financial side of the portfolio.All in all a good result but not enough to part with my hard earned to buy more at the current price.
