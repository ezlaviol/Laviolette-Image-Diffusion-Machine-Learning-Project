2016-03-30T16:25:00+11:00 : After watchen the market on ANZ & NAB for the pass week i decided to take a leap of faith and buy a big chunk of ANZ & NAB shares, i ended up buying ANZ @ $23.00 a share and brought NAB @ $25.50 a share.  Now before i get judged and im happy to get judged as no one really knows how much lower the share price might go, im thinking i got ANZ and NAB at a good price especially ANZ.  

I hope by Christmas i will be in the green, love to hear your thoughts on the share price i paid and if you think its a good all round price on both my buys.  

Please be Blunt and honest, 

Regards 
Darren
