All I can do is tell you what the basic value of a business is based on its intrinsic value. That does not mean it will trade at that value and might never. What the market decides to do is also another question. Look at the market now. We have quite a lot of undervalued stocks with low PEs that continue to crash daily and become cheaper. And overvalued ones with high PEs that continue to rise. When will normality return to this market. How long is that piece of string again. Or will it never and this is the new market norm.
