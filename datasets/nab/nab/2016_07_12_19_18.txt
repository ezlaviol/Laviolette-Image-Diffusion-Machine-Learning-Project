The commodities had a very small pullback. Still in favour but a lot of profit taking going on. Same as the rest of the ASX today. Profit taking. I did the same, took profits from NAB and ANZ. BOQ I'm willing to sit on. Any pullback will be small without a headwind.  US jobs gave a push but the push is only so hard. Without news I would guess commodities might start a little low tomorrow but recover over the day to be in a good position by day end tomorrow. But, with news then who knows. All you need for a good or bad day is for some idiot somewhere that doesn't deserve a job to predict a boom or bust. But that's just me guessing. We had a bit of a pullback today and just because I thought it would happen was pure chance. Let's wait and see. The only thing for certain is that is stocks such as these take no notice of what happens on HC.
