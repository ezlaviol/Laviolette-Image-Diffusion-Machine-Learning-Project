I thin the strategy has been studied to death and chasing dividends in that matter has not been shown to be effective. Last time when I was buying nab in the low 24's and then it went to 29 at ex date then sold @28.11 worked out as a good strategy. If you could repeat that a couple of times a year then good times. But there is nothing to say that you will buy at the right time or the sp will be in a good position to take a profit and you might become a longer term holder after all. Not that that's a bad thing. I'm pretty sure the most money has been made by average people by investing over long periods rather than trying to time the market. I'm just having too fun much to think about locking it all away for 20 years down the track.
