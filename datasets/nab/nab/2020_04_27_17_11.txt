2020-04-27T17:11:00+10:00 : It's a tough one, would I prefer ALU that has increased it's SP by 11,760% over ten years and for a while now been paying good dividends.  Or MAQ increase of 422% over 10 years (which was paying FF divs equal to banks up until a couple of years ago, as now they are temporarily suspended while they build more data centres for future growth and divs). Or CSL increase of 891% over ten years (41,936% over 26 years) paying a fantastic percentage divi based on what early investors paid for their shares, same with other two.As I said, each to their own, horses for courses, etc.  GL.
