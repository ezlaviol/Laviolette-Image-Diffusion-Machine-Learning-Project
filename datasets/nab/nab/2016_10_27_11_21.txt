Happy with that! It looks like their strategy is working and has put them in a good position for the future.

Agreed. For the past few years NAB has been out of favour amongst the Big 4 banks and similarly my strategy has been full participation in the DRP and also accumulating when it dipped.  It's taken a while and whilst the avg price of my holding is still a bit above the current SP, I think it's going to work well long term.

Got to say well done management. Aside from narrowing their focus with the divestments of non-core business which will take a little longer to show. I particularly like to read that expenses were tightly managed in the second half, CET1 ratios are above target and that their funding is well diversified given the macroeconomic environment with possible rate changes here and abroad and domestic property market commentary. Good work NAB.
