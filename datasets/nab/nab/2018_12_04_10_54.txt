2018-12-04T10:54:00+11:00 : RC is over, there was an article about public wanting an RC 2.0 that may have caused a scare ( I don't think it will happen).Keep in mind another article came outÂ about Liberals wanting the banking RC to quickly finish up so it is forgotten and also an early election is what they're after.Lot of political parts are moving also in the background, another problem the housing prices are falling but this is a good thing in my opinion as its needed for new home buyers to enter the market.Dont forget houses are needed and banks hold a monopoly in this game, the little online lenders out there are mostly owned by big banks anyway so every bank has one in their pocket.People are sitting in their parents houses waiting with cash, people get married and move out, now we can add gay marriage in the mix of people getting married and moving out.I really dont see how it will fail when Australia brings in thousands of people into Australia each month, they need somewhere to live also.The only problem is the house prices are still too high and that is a problem because who can afford it? Keep in mind when prices drop, just like in the stock market families/ investors/ individuals/ SMSF all jump in to take advantage of this and create a sideways movement in property prices.Oh and the RC will provide a full repoort in FEB from what I read, that's also going to be a problem.On the bright side CBA I believe its dividends are to be done in the next couple of months so that will create a pop in all bank stocks also as high tides float all boats.
