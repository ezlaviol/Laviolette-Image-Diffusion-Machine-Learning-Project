Lower interest rate environment means we need to significantly grow the loan book and or cost savings. Margins will be hit, plus the bad debt factor for all banks. Don’t expect $1.66 again in dividends for a long time, or $30. Remember it has around 3bn or so shares on issue (top of my head). Needs a lot of earnings to justify a $90bn market cap.
