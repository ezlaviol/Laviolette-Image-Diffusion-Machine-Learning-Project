One word of caution: Its tricky (and sometimes misleading) to combine capital gain with the wealth created by compounding a dividend return. 

So punters can understand the concepts better, I think it's best to try and separate those two things. E.g. If the NAB share price was around $2.75 then your capital growth has been about 12x (purely from share price movement to $33) and so your return from compounding the divvy has been around 6.5x your initial outlay.

So even if the NAB share price was still $2.75 your initia $1000 investment would now be $6500. 

The capital gain should be seen as a bonus.

Not sexy enough? If you were 25yrs from retirement and you could put $150K into something now to be confident of receiving $1 million upon retirement would you take that offer?
