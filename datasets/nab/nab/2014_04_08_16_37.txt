Adding to my earlier post... We also have a serious problem with our major banks being "to big to fail" without infecting the entire financial system.Whilst our banks seem fairly good at what they do, their size in market share remains a problem waiting to happen.Recently John Addis from Intelligent Investor stated similar.Can Australia reduce our big bank's % market share without creating bigger problems ?  How ? .
