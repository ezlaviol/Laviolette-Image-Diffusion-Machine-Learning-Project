2020-03-28T18:02:00+11:00 : Your argument are therefore investment philosophy is flawed. Comparing an illiquid asset like property is ludicrous.If you truly believe the price is going to $8 like you keep posting then you would sell now regardless of what you have paid in past and repurchase when your target price was achieved. Any capital loss from the sale would be carried forward to offset against futures gains. (Unless held in pension phase then tax is irrelevant). By continuing to hold while you keep making constant predictions of an $8 price shows you are inept at investing, a liar about holding, a shorter or still in school.To put it in perspective I'm on record with a number of posts on different stocks stating I have no idea how low the markets will fall, nor do I know if we have seen the bottom yet but i have been trickling buys in on stocks I think have upside when the market does finally turn. If I was as confident as you are that IN YOUR OWN WORDS: "$10 no problem, $8 realistic" I would be selling.And I've invested and bought and sold through every correction since and including 1987.
