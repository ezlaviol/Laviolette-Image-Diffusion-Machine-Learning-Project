2018-10-27T12:29:00+11:00 : So we will get around 10% dividend on current price ( ex early Nov) you think
Probably reduce later but unlikely to get anywhere near the best cash management interest rate you can get atm.

I also dont think we will see a shareprice decline of 10%

So im holding for this divvy and re assess later ( only been buying recently )

And if Shorten and his mob back down then watch the rebound

who knows
