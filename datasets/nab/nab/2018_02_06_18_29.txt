2018-02-06T18:29:00+11:00 : I recall during the GFC (not suggesting that we are in a GFC sized correction just yet) that the DJIA futures were incredibly misleading, and were almost a contrarian indicator for the actual session numbers so if futures are deeply red I'll be expecting a green session for the DJIA.  

In any case I don't think this is about a single session now, the cat is out of the bag and the market knows that the DJIA could be up or down by over 1,000 points in any given session. I imagine that will change investment behaviours significantly over the following weeks and months.
