Suspension of dividends is fine by me so long as it ensures we can thrive in the future. If you need the $ sell 0.80c distribution worth of shares. Equally Iâ€™d argue large superfund redemptions for the $20k per person effected by Corona is causing a liquidity crisis, banks and one of a few liquid large caps on the ASX to dump with low prospect of dividends. Couple in hedging losses in the billions for large funds as quoted in the Australian... can see why our share market tanked. The same funds will buy back up once liquidity issue is gone as contributions roll back in to a net inflow as opposed to outflow.
