If they had to count their loans, both business and home loans that are actually being deffered as bad they are in real trouble unless these turn around massively by the time job keeper and the housing loan freeze ends. There is a reason Ross came out today pleading with people in distress to sell now rather than wait. There costs are also blowing out. Would be 50/50 at best to pay a div at the end of the year and in my book the next year looks worse. Am a long term holder, but lets be honest about these results - awful.
