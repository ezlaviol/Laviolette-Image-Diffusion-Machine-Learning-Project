2020-05-28T21:40:00+10:00 : I think it's the earnings/dividend yield. Even at the 70% reduced rate of 60c dividend per share, that was around 6% grossed up dividend yield at a share price of $15. Bank interest is 0% to 1%. But putting that aside, just a couple years earlier, in normal times, the dividend was around $2.80 per share, including franking credits. If the share price remained at $15, that's a grossed dividend yield of 19%. And I think as we're beginning to see the virus effects on the economy fade, and hopes of a return to more normal times grow, investors might be eyeing that juicy $2 fully franked dividend once again. (I sold out of the rally at $16.55 thinking it had to pull back, when I'd re-enter. Even though I knew the shares were cheap. I can't bring myself to buy now, so I've just screwed myself. That's a lesson learnt for me - don't try to time the market.)
