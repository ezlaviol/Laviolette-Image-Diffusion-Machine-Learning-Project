Lesson 1 ... P/E Ratio:  When stocks trade on a PE ratio of around 10 this means they are cheap!  It means that for every $1 of earnings you will pay $10 meaning you would get your captial back in roughly 10 years of earnings.When BANKS are trading at PE's of around 10 they are very cheap!! Look at NCP it's got a PE of about 40 .. expensive!!!  What would you prefer...
