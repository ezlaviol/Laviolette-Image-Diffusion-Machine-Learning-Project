2020-03-12T17:51:00+11:00 : it doesn’t matter how much it falls. Even if it falls 90%, it always recuperate.  Even after the “Armageddon” in the 80’s (AIDS), the stock market recuperated. It always does! One just have to look away for 6 months - 2 years and it’s like it never happened. It just dumbfounds me that people are SELLING. Why not throw the money in the sea instead? MUCH less anxiety and dwelling that way as well... especially when the ASX hit new highs in 18 months or so (even a recession don’t last longer than 9 months on average) people just dwell to death of how weak they were, selling into the hype. well, weak hands to strong hands, that’s how it goes....
