There will be lot less new loans given out as its difficult to meet the tight criteria set by the banks which will hurt future earnings.. & puts a cloud over if current dividends are sustainable...  I know someone was refused for 100k loan on 1mil property when he had 900k in cash, really not a good outlook in my eyes...
