2019-12-11T05:46:00+11:00 : The WBC fiasco is still unfolding - the amount of their fine is expected to be known over the next three months or so - all banks will decline in SP in sympathy so maybe there is an expectation rather than any basis on reality.Good time to reassess the hold or sell strategy I suppose. Banks are good investments but always good to pick the time to consider the option to  park money elsewhere until the dust settles. Who knows? I don't.
