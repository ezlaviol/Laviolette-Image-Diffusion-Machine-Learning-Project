As @maya.m said she/he is resonably well off, but it still hurts.I'm definately no expert, but when asked I gave this advice to a fella I know a couple of years ago, he was a couple of years from planned retirement at 60 based on his super at time, but he hung in there with the banks, etc for just that little more.  Now looks like closer to 65 is going to be his retirement date.Good luck all, crazy times.
