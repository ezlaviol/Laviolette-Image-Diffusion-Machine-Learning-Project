2021-08-07T13:50:00+10:00 : probably not a direct comparison but AMP had a share buyback on market that went on for a few weeks and the sp went from $1 to $1.25 or so... a gain of 25%...I am sure something like that will never happen because of NAB buying back $2.5 billion shares so what is the max upside possible now with this buyback about to go live... we can consider the low of $25.08 as our starting point... a 10% increase in SP from low of late July? Or is 10% too big a run solely based on the buyback?not a holder, just doing some research and wanted to see how these buybacks affect short term price movement...(BTW AMP sp is back to $1.04 after the buyback stopped - but as I said, these two stocks are not good to compare)
