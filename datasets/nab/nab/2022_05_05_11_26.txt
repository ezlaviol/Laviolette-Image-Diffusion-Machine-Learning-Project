2022-05-05T11:26:00+10:00 : When the SP got to $13 in 2020- I thought that I might wait for $12- I am still in therapy for that.The presentation, page 21, indicates that 25bps change in rate could change NIM by 2bps. So, thinking that the macro will be the important thing going forward.Too silly to buy at $13 but not silly enough to buy at $32.Interesting days ahead for sector.IMHO DYOR
