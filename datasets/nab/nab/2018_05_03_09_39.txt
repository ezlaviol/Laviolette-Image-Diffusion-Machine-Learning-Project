2018-05-03T09:39:00+10:00 : Finally getting rid of MLC, l worked for NAB for 18 years and l can tell for a fact the the marriage between the 2 of them was always doomed from day one. l can always remember Frank Cicutto famous words on the day NAB announced they bought MLC, saying "we bought the best house on the block" What a joke it was shell company that had previously failed to merge with AXA.  JB Were was always their preferred option as its Melbourne based. MLC been in Sydney always had its cultural and management differences.   Good luck to the current MLC staff, as the next move after it is detached from NAB is to move operation from Melbourne to Sydney.
