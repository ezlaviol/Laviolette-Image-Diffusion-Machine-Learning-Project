But overall the financial sector looks to have had its day in the sun. In a falling interest rate environment financials generally outperform but in a rising rate situation then the opposite usually occurs. The bigger problem here is that the genius'es that control the system have forced rates artificially low by a wide margin inducing punters to buy overpriced assets for under priced money.A reversal is in the process of taking place.
