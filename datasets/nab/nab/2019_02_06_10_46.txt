2019-02-06T10:46:00+11:00 : Purchased some PUT Warrants this morning in NAB. Nice little trade. With current volatility opportunities present themselves on both sides of the market. A board clean out could see a pop in share price followed by a further pop of suitable appointments. If the current mob are going to tough it out then that may cap any gains for the time being. Play safe if trading this.
