The market is trying to find a bottom, is close to the bottom, but still trying to be satisfied there is a bottom and by looking at the false starts and twists, it is close to finding it. By virtue of the T/A, I do not think we have quite found it yet. I hope for more certainty from Government, central banks and companies.
