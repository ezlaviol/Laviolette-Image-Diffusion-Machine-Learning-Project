2020-05-02T09:01:00+10:00 : There are so many areas where people spend there money these days ( Holidays, concerts, sports, eating out, alcohol, gambling etc) that were not a huge priority when I was younger. My son & his wife are in their late 20's certainly enjoy more entertainment activities than I ever did and yet have a nice villa and a mortgage and are well ahead in their repayments. It all depends where your priorities are, if you don't over commit on your first house ,work reasonably hard and don't waste your money, the great Australian dream is still there for most people.
