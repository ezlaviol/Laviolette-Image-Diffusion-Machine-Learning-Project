2019-10-16T17:11:00+11:00 : We are talking about interest they get on their home loans aren't we?If you want to investigate further, there was something on the business programme (ABC) on the week end - and that was to do with the big 4 banks being unable to pass the cuts on in full - and also mentioned the reliance on home loan interest as funding whereas smaller financial institutions get 100% from borrowing on the global markets.The 60% reliance figure was from a year or so after the GFC - that may have changed a bit but still be relevant.

I'm pretty sure that they get zero funding from home loans.  They fund the home loans.
