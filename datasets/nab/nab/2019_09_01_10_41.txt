Because, that is what we would get and the APRA rules are tighter but not too much of an imposition. Maybe do a bit more analysis on that.Thing is that they still make decent profits - and still pay decent dividends. So, why would anyone want to sell shares in banks now?

Bank are not making strong profits now by being fined and attacked by ASIC at every turn & APRA is controlling them into a bleak future as I see it and so does RBA which is dropping the cash rate because it can see the future better than all of us. Might seem a drastic statement but Banks are doomed under APRA control.
