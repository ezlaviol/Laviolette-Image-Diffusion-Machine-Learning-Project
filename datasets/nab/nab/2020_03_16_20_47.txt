That is what is driving the price down and you need to factor in some part of this effect going forward.The alternative which is what has been promulgated is that for the majority of people there will be no effect.  Nothing to mitigate the effect would be done and the economic effect may have been 10-15%.In looking forward, you look at what may happen and factor that in to what will happen to the market and therefore the price of NAB.Probably regret making the post, haven't worked out how to delete it.
