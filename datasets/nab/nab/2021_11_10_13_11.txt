2021-11-10T13:11:00+11:00 : You may well be right.  But the 'experts' were also telling of us doom and gloom 18 months ago and Aussie property prices falling 20-30%.  Got that one wrong didn't they?  Very few anal-ysts ever call stocks well.  Its the perpetual buy echo chamber until the market falls and they just go quiet for a while.  Were these analysts calling the banks the screaming buy they were in April 2020?
