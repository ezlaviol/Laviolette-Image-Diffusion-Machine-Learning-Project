2020-03-24T10:40:00+11:00 : There was a series of announcements yesterday

some notes were bought back

some notes were converted without notice to equity- - 35 m new shares issued at 2135 ish

glad those that were looking for cash got it

clearly some didn’t and got some nice shares which are underwater and represent a big overhang

more of these style products will be converted in time imo, the potential to covert has always been in the contracts

some are writing online it wasn’t a bail in and they are correct, a bail in is when you didn’t have the risk and didn’t have a choice - the bank just converted soMe of their notes - nothing dodgy whatsoever - they had the right and it was reflected in the higher returns over market they had been paying - more will coMe in the banking sector , its the risks associated with these products that was compensated for by the banks with higher than market interest
