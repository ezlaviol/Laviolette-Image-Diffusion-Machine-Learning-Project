The following one might be a different story. NAB iirc has more business exposure than residential and should be least effected by any changes in the future. Let's not forget that NG has been removed before to utter failure and re instated. The ALP couldn't organize a raffle at a tea party. IMO $27 will be pretty decent support without a good bout of bad news. Under that will be interesting and if it breaks into the $25 range on no real bad news it might head towards a low $25 or under with a push. Which would be just lovely. And generally being a whole sector movement the other 3 should be suffering as well. Even BoQ was in the $10 range. I'm sure there be some bargains in the next few months giving investors the chance to pick up a gain on sp + div.
