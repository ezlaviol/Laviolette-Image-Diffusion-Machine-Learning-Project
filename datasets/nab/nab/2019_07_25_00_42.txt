2019-07-25T00:42:00+10:00 : You're too kind about NAB. the current perception in the media about the new CEO wanting to cut costs by sacking staff seems strange. Is this to make ASX investors believe NAB profits will rise by reducing staff costs? Which 4000 staff would they be cutting? Does bank management really wish to make all their staff quake in their shoes believing they could be losing their jobs next year? Is this a well-conceived media management release?  Is this a sign for recruiters to start headhunting for other banks and finance companies?  Does NAB wish to risk losing their best staff assets? The best solution for NAB is to convert the bank into a full-blown finance company with a very capable staff core, very suitable for the finance company environment. Why have expensive retail branches? Why not move to cheaper office accommodation saving a fortune in retail rents and outgoings..Best they concentrate.to provide finance for cars, equipment, fleet leasing, commercial deals OR  maybe even try to emulate Macquarie Bank however in the meantime the new CEO is IMO on the wrong track to dismantle the best finance company in Australia ...also currently financing AfterPay. I've met some 2x4's ex NAB people (Never would borrow from them) and I'm sure there are plenty more of the ex Custom Credit people the RC found so objectionable. The NAB has made so many mistakes losing $billions in USA people have long forgotten about and new investors are unaware of,, then the Clysdale Bank disaster and what else they lost by venturing out of their core skills of lending money in Australia. I do have a BIG Questionmark over the AfterPay funding deal and I'm surprised APRA not been asking questions or maybe i'm too cautious lol. Readers should do more research because these are just my own opinions only and not advice. DYOR
