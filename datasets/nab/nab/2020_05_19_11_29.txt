I agree it's not easy to trade short term but since I have no other distractions or income my strategy will be to sell 25% of my shares or 3,000 nab shares per week once they are in the over bought section of the nab charts and only buy them back if they are cheaper than what I sell them for. my brokerage a flat $9.50 regardless of the size of the trade. ie: a $150,000 trade will cost me $9.50 and not a cent more.
