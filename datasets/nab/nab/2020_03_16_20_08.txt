I’ve seen plenty of posts over the last few days especially, on FB and Twitter, all claiming to be Doctors and specialists. 

Each one more hysterical than the last.

Read one the other day that claimed “if you are in your 20’s, and you go out to the supermarket, you will kill 15% of the people over 80 you come in contact with”.

These posts are all BS, totally designed to instead fear and panic. Not something any professional would do. 

I’m starting to think something really stinks with this virus crap. 

I’ve been noticed once level headed HC posters declare they are packing up the van and hurting the road to avoid the impending Armageddon. 

5 deaths in Australia, three in the 90’s. 

The more we shut down shops, sporting events, schools etc the more the population panics. 

Meanwhile, middle class fools trip over themselves to offload their quality blue chip shares and the wealthy are just scooping them up.

London to a brick, when the dust settles, the rich will be significantly richer. 

This whole thing smells. Big time.
