The larger holders are all generally institutions who hold on behalf of the masses superfunds in pooled investment schemes. Ie your Australian super, HESTA, CBUS etc. Their investment strategies won’t change as a result of this. The franking credits were always pulled across all members. No drastic change here besides a little bit of a jig to their effective tax rates. 

Secondly your large your large retail holders ie 10,000 to 100,000 shares bandwidth are all top tax bracket or hold these in companies - thus not effected.

It’s your middle class with only SMSF holdings (ie 500- a few thousand shares) or low income earners in person names who are effected. They will no longer get the franking refunds. However SMSF - just add your kids to the fund and soak up their contributions tax with franking credits, greedy labor gets nothing from your and the contributions for your kids are technically tax free from a total structure point of view  any franking credits left over? Well sell some Australian shares and buy USA based stocks or indexes funds. My aim is 0 net tax to labor for our fund.
