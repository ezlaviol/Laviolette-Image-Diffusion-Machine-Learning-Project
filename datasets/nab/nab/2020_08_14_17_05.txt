If it wasn’t COVID, a recession would have got them. Car leases etc too, idiotic keeping up with the Jones types. Anyway, some sold, now renting, others not. My point is, a vaccine will change this, or at least it’ll moderate. Lest we forget the Spanish flu which was worse than this, our banking institutions still exist after that. Id be hard pressed if I was an auditor saying you have to impair every loan to bad debts provisions who have deferred. A lot of jobs will return, especially as it’s a short term freeze. Money is cheap too, businesses do have access to a lot of cheap credit. As things return to normal they will too. The government is bailing everyone out because it has to, it’s not anyone’s fault, it’s China. We and the world will be on government life lines until normality returns. Think of it as keeping the oxygen in the room, until we are above water!!!
