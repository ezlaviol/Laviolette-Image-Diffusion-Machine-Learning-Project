2018-01-21T14:16:00+11:00 : buying stocks for yield alone is unwise.
have a look at Telstra's great yield.  but the share price is still south of what my Dad paid
for it many years ago at around $7.
whereas a good friend of mine loaded up on CSL , Ramsay and  Cochlear at listing.  
dividends tiny by comparison but the capital growth has been astronomical.
