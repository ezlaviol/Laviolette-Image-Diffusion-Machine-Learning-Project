2016-11-09T20:36:00+11:00 : Trump wins. Remember Brexit.  ASX tumbled then , same again.  Trump was all about reclaiming US borders so was the UK.

IMO  expect stocks to rebound just as they did after Brexit. Brexit was also going to be the end of the world .  Remember what happened to stocks then.

Stocks might do well with trump as the skipper.  A few days and up she goes.
