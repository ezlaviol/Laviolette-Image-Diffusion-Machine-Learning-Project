2016-07-27T12:23:00+10:00 : Not exactly splurging. I'd be happy to grab a few more. I was planning on 10k max but I'm closer to 20k now. And that will be 30k if it goes back to 10. Targets are still ANZ 23's (not gonna happen) nab (24's very doubtful). Who knows what the next couple of months will bring. Without a decent drop I probably won't buy anything else. But twitchy fingers
