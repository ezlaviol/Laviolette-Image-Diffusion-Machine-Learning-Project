But.... Mr Market is still not convinced that NAB is the real deal. Dividend yield of 6.8% tells the story in a market where yield is king. 

Hard to find an ASX200 company with higher yield. Don't get me wrong I love divvy yield & it's a massive part of my strategy but I do wonder when is the NAB share price going to have a run that brings the yield back in line with the overall market and/or sector?
