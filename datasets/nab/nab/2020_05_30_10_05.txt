2020-05-30T10:05:00+10:00 : I doubt it. Many would have already sold some shares after applying (and before offer closed) to 'lock in' a premium or would have sold some shares in the last few days on the big rally. And the remainder, may not sell or if they do, probably won't make a ripple on the market price. I suspect the dog days are over and we won't see sub $16 again soon, but may be wrong on that.
