Logic would say if they do cut the share price will rise further and it could be rather strong considering many of these banks are unlikely to pass on much of the rate cut to their customers.

I just don't know if it will work in the Australian economy if the banks are really running their own show consumers may become apathetic to rate cuts.  Short term boast to the banks bottom line but going into 2016 if consumers start to shop around for better deal loans and cut back on reliance on the big 4 we could see some further softness at the big end of town.
