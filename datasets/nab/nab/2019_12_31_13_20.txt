2019-12-31T13:20:00+11:00 : Legacy portfolio reasons because CBA has such a big portfolio, the old State Bank of Victoria, BankWest, ASB, it is the biggest in terms of legacy mortgages and mortgages in Australia are really the preserve of the Big 4 majors, good credits can’t really go elsewhere. their NIM and low delinquencies and ability to withstand the Great Recession (a.k.a GFC in Australian English) is a function of the legacy portfolio and the capital buffers that it provides.Neobanks are a mighty fine thing, but I can’t see too many good credits getting their multi-millionaire AUD lending from a Neobank, they do not have the capital capacity, so will have the lower hanging fruit.NAB should do well next year but WBC and ANZ should on the basis of their portfolios perhaps may do a bit better. And I only really care about SPs, I leave the dividends and franking credits considerations to the Aussie residents to worry about it. I mainly care about the gap filling and there is a lot of it.The gaps in the Australian banks are a trading anomaly IMHO caused by Australian banks at least three of them being discounted in price due to potential for more scandals, they are almost priced for more scandal IMHO but pls DYODD. it might be FOMO time, I think FONGO time has well passed.
