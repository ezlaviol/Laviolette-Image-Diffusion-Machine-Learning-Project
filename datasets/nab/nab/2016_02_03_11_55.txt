2016-02-03T11:55:00+11:00 : Depends on the result of the share sale.  There hasn't been a set price that has been announced, as the sales haven't been made.
I suspect that, with the CYB shares being listed at 180 pence (approx A$3.70), shareholders who sell through the NAB facility would get approximately that much - but again, depends on how much the shares sell for.
