2019-02-08T14:20:00+11:00 : Is it also a bad look to have ex politicians, especially ex state premiere's, potentially leveraging their previous public position to benefit a corporate entity at the expense of the voters? We have already seen that the regulators have been neutralised by mates deals etc. This could be perceived as a further step to influence Liberal party policies, and regulatory outcomes at the voters expense (and this is already probably happening to a lessor extent than if he was CEO). I suspect the Henry was also probably leveraging his political and government connections and knowledge against the interests of the people. I hope that Baird will not apply for the role.

I think we need to think carefully about how we can make our regulators more effective, and a ban on moving across from government to corporations, or significant restrictions including banning the use of knowledge gained from a regulatory or government positions would be a great start. I believe Lawyers have such a responsibility re conflict of interest in their everyday work, and sometimes need to recuse themselves. (I've forgotten the terminology). Ex ministers, government heads and senior regulatory people are being unethical IMO if they use their previous position to enrich a corporation and themselves. We would also then raise the quality of our government, as people would have the right motivations in going for the role.
