I own/run my owner business as well as invest in property and NAB have been far better than what CBA were when i dealt with them. NAB were willing to give deals, better rates etc whilst CBA would stick to their computers system.

I found this a much better approach and i think with NAB's earnings in the business sector being strong they have a lot of upside on getting home loan market share from CBA especially if we have a rates rise.
