There is no doubt that both codes have been used to spending all their money and will have to restructure and reduce costs.
There will, however, still be demand for the sports and the money will still roll in from attendance and broadcast deals.
The Banks will ensure they have their hand firmly on the first part of these funds and the codes will have to work with what they have left including building up reserves for next time!
Unless we see a complete change in Australian culture and collapse of interest in sport I do not see this as high risk, although the banks will certainly need to put in strong covenants and ensure change!
