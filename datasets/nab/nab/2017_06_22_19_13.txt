2017-06-22T19:13:00+10:00 : NAB will fall tomorrow in response,... many may not know of this yet. And NAB has a lot of work to do to contest this tax now,.... no sooner than the bank levy thing was approved, now they need to contend with this tax ?? Soon the banks will spend all their time defending against taxes than going after new businesses and serving clients...

Are the other 3 big banks plus Macquarie hit by this supertax too ? What abt the regionals ?
