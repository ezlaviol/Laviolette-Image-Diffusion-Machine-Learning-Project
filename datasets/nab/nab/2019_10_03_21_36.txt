2019-10-03T21:36:00+10:00 : one owner occupier property per lender is not a capitalist society. Hard for NAB to survive with that. Fall today was not as bad as expected.the Ross McEwen effect could cause anything, it may fall at the wrong time. under McEwen, RBS SP was woeful and they cut employees and it never recovered from the governance, risk and compliance scandals.arguably CBA got into the morose mess that it is in because of the Narev McEwen scandals.NAB is fighting against historical reference points that are reputationally awful.NAB is a pizza full of risk topping.
