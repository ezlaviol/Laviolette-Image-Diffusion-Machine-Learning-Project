Our major exports look comfortable, but anything to do with external tourism or travel will still be on the nose. Still we don't seem to own cruise ships, but Qantas might pick up the internal travel. Big business might look at starting up more manufacturing for internal consumption. My Crystal ball is in its wishful thinking phase, Cheers, Japes.
