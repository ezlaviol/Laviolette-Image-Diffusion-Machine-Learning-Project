Problem with cba is the amount of capital needed to make it worthwhile. Ben featured well with a short warnings recently. Might take a while for the covering to start but I'm going to make sure I have the patience to sit through the games until it starts. I like BOQ as its not too far away from its 52 week low although I'm pretty much fully invested in that even though I missed the lower buys. I'll just ride that one unless it gets to 10.5 and I might grab a few more. ANZ & NAB only picked up 1k each. If nab hits 26.6 I'll sell and wait until it gets back down again. If it doesn't then on to mid 25's! ANZ I'll be looking for about 23.5ish. The fun has started with red numbers already ! Actually I'm already up on Ben and ANZ lol. If you count profits in tiny numbers of course, but green is green. Might be red on Tuesday!

GL to us !
