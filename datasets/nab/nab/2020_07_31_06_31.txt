As you say though, there are those funds that make it an income stream for them alone.Bank SP's may take a hit today with the DOW down 225 points. I do believe that bank SP's are already priced low so maybe the hit won't do that much damage.

The banks have never been so full. As everyone is pulling their money out of super it's going straight into their bank accounts. Then they may buy shares rather than put their trust is some fund that charges those ridiculous fees to do the same. by the way... I do not believe in super, it is just an industry that serves itself
