2021-02-07T11:58:00+11:00 : Banks are encouraging their customers to go online as they continue to invest heavily in technology. Online payment via mobile is common in Asia (if the articles I read were accurate). The trend of banks shutting their branches even in cities will continue unfortunately. Hope to hear positive news from the banks in coming reporting season. Big four should do well, imo.
