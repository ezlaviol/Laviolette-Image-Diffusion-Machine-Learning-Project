SP not dropping below 17 or high 16s any more.. its found new support.. resistance seems to be around 19.. but will it should break that 19 resistance by early Dec. Whatever you buy in Mid Nov, dont sell until SP rides to $25.. should be before April. This is not free advise.. i'd like a % of the profits you make using this advise.
