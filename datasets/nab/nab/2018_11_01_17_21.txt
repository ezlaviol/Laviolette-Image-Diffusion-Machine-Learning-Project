2018-11-01T17:21:00+11:00 : Dont see NAB Dividend/Distributions remaining this high going forward. Increased scrutiny/policies under RC, sell off of financial advice departs similar to CBA, reduced interest rates, increased lending requirements (less loans). 14% less profit. You cant maintain payout of profits to SH if they aren't the same.Thats not to say NAB isnt a worthy stock, IMO I just see a divy yield cut. Been mentioned by more than one business analyst.
