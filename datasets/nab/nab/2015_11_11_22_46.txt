Based on the weekly, it may bounce, but imo I think low $26 is possible, depends whether a Xmas rally pans out. No Xmas rally could see low $26 before years end. If Xmas rally arrives then low $26 may push out to Feb/Mar next year.





I think a second opinion is needed.

Short term horizon yesterday 's dip and retest was worth a trade.
