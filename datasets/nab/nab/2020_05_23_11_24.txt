2020-05-23T11:24:00+10:00 : Alan has a point - a few years back, CBA management was getting smashed and they had a change at the top - I think NAB got some compliments at the time - times have changed and CBA has largely cleaned up its act. I would like to think NAB stated that process at the end of last year.Thanks for passing that information from AK.

On the ABC news a few weeks ago, Alan Kohler was giving his nightly review of the markets of the day and got onto to the state of the banks.He was comparing the sp of the big 4, he said that the only difference between CBA and the others was management.  Or in the case of the other 3, was mismanagement.I haven’t heard of anyone calling him out on it, and is still on the air.
