There could be criminal charges reccomended and there'll also be the political fallout. If the findings are put out before the election, then we can expect more bank bashing and promises to get tough on them by Labor and the Coalition.

So I don't think the banks are out of the woods yet. I was looking at NAB this time last year but I'm glad I didn't buy any.
