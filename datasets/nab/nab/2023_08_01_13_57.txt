2023-08-01T13:57:00+10:00 : a pause on rates today will see us into the $29’s sooner rather than laterall banks have bounced back well from the sell off last month so today is another critical pivot.NAB has never been a Long hold for me. I luv making money on this stock as it's so cyclical (a yoyo stock)low $30’s ceiling/resistance and mid $20’s lows.. time and time again.patience is key with this stock and i never look for timing perfection. if i can make 1 years worth of divs in a relatively quick trade i do, and then I wait for the next retrace. if i miss the sell i load up more on the retrace.let's see what the RBA does today.good luck all.
