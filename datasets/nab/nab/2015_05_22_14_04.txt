NAB has come back from recent highs around $40.

I'm considering to buy some.

New Shares under the Retail Entitlement Offer commence trading on ASX on a normal settlement basis Friday, 12 June 2015.  Given this entittlement at 28.50 and very few shares. 

Do investors see much downside to the current price ?  ( assuming no major market sell offs)

Thoughts on downside please feel free to comment.  at 5.9% Div I think this is shaping as a good longterm at around $30 or low 30's  Like to hear others opinions...
