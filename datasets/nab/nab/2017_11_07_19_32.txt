2017-11-07T19:32:00+11:00 : Just a visual for comparisons.  Upwards trend since June not broken.

NAB last 6 months.


ANZ last 6 months.


WBC last 6 months , and you can see from the chart why WBC didn't seem to fall in last two days as much as the other two did.....had already curled over well before the result was announced.


So you can see looking at the charts that NAB and WBC sp both sit just above the 50 day MA  line (gold) while ANZ is just through it.  Personally I think the charts back up what I'm saying about an institutional re-weighting, ie controlled.

With NAB being the first to go XD on Thursday, it will be interesting to see how far they push it down given it's already down more than the divvy it's carrying since FY result last Thursday.  Other two both go XD next Monday.

If they push NAB down to the 100 day MA line (blue) on Thursday, that would be circa the divvy amount again, but note that the uptrend since June would still not be broken.

Also note the gap down on the FY result day (all 3)........gaps need to be filled ! 

Of course just my observations and imo !
