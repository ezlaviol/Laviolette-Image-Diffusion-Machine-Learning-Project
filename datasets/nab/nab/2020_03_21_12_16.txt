2020-03-21T12:16:00+11:00 : What alarmist rubbish!!This virus pandemic will be a short term impact. Life will move on briskly afterwards. We wonâ€™t be taking about it next year. Can bank shares get cheaper. Of course they can in this hysterical and emotionally driven market. But in the medium to long term the Bank shares will do fine. Same was said on the mining giants like BHP,Rio Etc in 2015 when the likes of you were calling for blood and saying that BHP would not survive and it was a gambling stock. Yeh right!!!I was buying at $17 and at $15 and at $13. Then was vindicated when these stocks climbed out of the slide and hit recent highs. Chill out. This will be terrible in the short term but we as a collective will make it through. Back half of this year things should have settled down.
