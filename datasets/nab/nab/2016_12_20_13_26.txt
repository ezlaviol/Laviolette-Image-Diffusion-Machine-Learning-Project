2016-12-20T13:26:00+11:00 : My view is that NAB will be led primarily by the US market. The DJIA is looking very much like the elephant in the trading room, trading at an incredibly high level IMHO and looks absolutely ripe for a 10%-15% correction in the near future. I'll avoid using the term "crash" but that's possible too.

This is purely conjecture on my part and I have absolutely no basis for it except that after 25 odd years in this game I've seen this cycle repeated many times without fail.

So my call is short term NAB looks great and should move towards $31-$32 comfortably.

Medium term, I can see a US led market correction taking the ASX down a peg and that would be the next opportunity to buy for LT hold IMHO.
