2020-06-11T13:18:00+10:00 : I will be selling everything by June 30 as I believe the shit is going to hit the fan big time in the US, they will have to go into lock down again as they are spiralling out of control , just look at Texas, Florida and California big spikes in cases as they open up their economies !!! We will be going for a big fall in July IMHO

There are still 1,142,777 active Covid cases in the U.S. :-
