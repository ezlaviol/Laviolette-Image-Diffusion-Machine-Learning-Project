2020-05-28T13:02:00+10:00 : Agree 100%. Three years back I went long term on NAB. It has been a total disaster. Any body who bought NAB 10 years back is sitting today on massive losses. Except one of two stock, rest are below 2010 price now. Means 10 years Zero  Gain. Dividend does not pay Interest itself...Those who are on 100K plus salary and don't mind writing off losses, for them Long Term works pretty well...Any one who need to pay Debt, he/she need to take profit or loss at least Quarterly Basis else all can end in total disaster...
