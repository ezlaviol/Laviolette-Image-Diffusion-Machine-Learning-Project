NAB looks like it has been oversold based on unsubstantiated rumors about the Clydesdale Bank IPO.

Looks to have been falsely considered a weaker play than the other three banks due to their lack of foreign or offshore exposure, u would think that was a good thing given the volatility in the PRC and the European/ England and US markets at the moment.
