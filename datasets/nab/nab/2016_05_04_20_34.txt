2016-05-04T20:34:00+10:00 : I think we will get to $1.00, but who really knows. And just as importantly what will happen to the SP?

WBC increased divi, profit was higher and the SP sank. ANZ cut divi, profit dropped and soared. Go figure. The market seems both fickle and brutal at the moment.

Good luck to all (except shorters)..... hope you get burnt.... badly....
