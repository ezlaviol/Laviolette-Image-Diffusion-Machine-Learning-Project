Yes, that's fear. But that's also when you should buy. You could've bought QAN at half the price, NAB at $13, CBA at $54 and so on. Markets are forward looking. The bottom is loooonnngggg in the rear view mirror now.

I'm curious as to your age? I have a belief that because many adult Australians have never known a recession, let alone a depression, that there is a blind optimism that prevails. Depressions don't just come and go with a quick sell off and all is well.
