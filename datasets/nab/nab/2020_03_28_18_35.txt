2020-03-28T18:35:00+11:00 : The competition is predatory though and debases local companies to the benefit of offshore ones, and many consumers simply don't realise.Like my local pizza shop, now has to offer delivery via UberEats. Like HELLO, Pizza shops have had home delivery since what, the 70's or 80's? A lot of young men saved to upgrade their car running pizzas each night. Now you can't do that.It's not just a surcharge, the local business bear a cost of ~ 25-30%.That's not competition. It's predatory on the business and one less opportunity.So long as you know when yo use that platform, you realise what you're actually doing.
