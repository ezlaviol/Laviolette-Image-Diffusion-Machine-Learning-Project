	  Energy, banks top drags on ASX 200  
 

	  NZX 50 logs third-straight weekly gain  
  	Australian shares fell on Friday, dragged down by losses in financial and energy stocks, while investors exercised caution amid increasing bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates. 	The benchmark index S&P/ASX 200  (xjo)  closed around 0.13% lower at 7,049.1 points. The benchmark has added 1% this week. 	Investors largely focused on data this week that showed the U.S. consumer price index was unchanged in October and that the core rate was up 0.2%, weaker than anticipated, with market participants revising their forecasts for future Fed action.  FEDWATCH  	In Sydney, the heavyweight financials index  .AXFJ  fell 0.1%, their lowest level since Nov. 2. The sub-index marked two straight weeks of losses with shares down over 0.5% this week.   	ANZ Group  (ANZ)  led losses in the sub-index slumping by 0.5%. Westpac Banking  (WBC)  shrunk 0.2% while National Australia Bank  (NAB)  was flat.  	Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade said the high number of jobs created in addition to a jump in the Wage Price Index (WPI) meant that the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) job was not necessarily done yet with rate hikes.  	"This uncertainty over whether the RBA has more work to do on the interest rate front weighed on sentiment today, with financial stocks facing some headwinds in particular," he added. 	Energy stocks  .AXEJ  fell 1.6% to their lowest level since May 4, to log its fourth consecutive week of losses, as oil prices sunk over worries of global oil demand following weak data from the U.S. and Asia.	 	Woodside Energy  (WDS)  dropped 2.3% while Santos  (STO)  fell around 0.1%. 	Among other sectors, local mining stocks  .AXMM  rose 0.4% and gold stocks  .AXGD  gained 2.6%, tech stocks  .AXIJ  jumped nearly 0.4%, while healthcare stocks  .AXHJ  advanced around 0.3%. 	 Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index  (nz50)  fell around 0.5% to 11,176.97 points. The benchmark clocked three straight weeks of gains, adding over 0.3% in value this week.
