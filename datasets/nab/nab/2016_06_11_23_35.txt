2016-06-11T23:35:00+10:00 : I looked into shorting but I have no desire to gamble with somebody else's stock or spend time making costly mistakes learning the ropes. I far prefer owning the stocks and minimise losses by staying away from high risk specs (and potentially big wins and big losses). As far as expecting a drop that was no more than a guess and it could have gone either way. But as I owned a good chunk of NAB and saw a good exit @28.11 after ex div I took the chance. That's also the reason I start my average in small around 26. I'm still expecting a drift lower but if it does have a bounce next week I'll sell out then wait for the drop to continue if it does and buy back in at 26 again and start the cycle. I'll always back my judgement with my own money but not with somebody else's. That's risky business unless you know what yr doing and a few good trades might just give me the confidence to take bigger risks than I would normally take. Casual trading suits me better. That's why I like stocks like bank stocks. Boring to a lot of people and a slow way to make money, but slowly making money let's me sleep at night. I'm already thinking about that nice fat dividend coming on the 1st July and if things play out well a much bigger one come December. Just in time for xmas 

As far as CBA is concerned, I wish I knew. Good buy for me at 70 but I wouldn't even take a start above 73 and I'll take a few if it gets there. Maybe a bid @70.01. I'm liking the looks of BEN right now if the shorters keep at it. Picked up 1k @ 9.22. Like to see it in the 8s for some more. If it gets back to the 13's then amen, even 12 will be nice. Either way I'll be averaging down or making a profit. You know how it rolls, it either goes up or down  and the timing of whether that's good or bad is all in relation to how deep yr in the sheet.

Good luck for Tuesday. Do you mind me asking at what price you took a punt?
