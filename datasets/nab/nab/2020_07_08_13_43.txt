Likewise the implication that a hq in Melbourne vs one in Sydney would impact management's ability and produce worse shareholder outcomes. Again a ridiculously tenuous proposition at best As for whether further lockdowns in Aus will cause more concern for banks. Of course they will. It doesn't take a Rhodes scholar to work that out. The benefit is that it is still within the federal governments support period with jobkeeper and jobseeker running. Thus the impact should be minimal.
