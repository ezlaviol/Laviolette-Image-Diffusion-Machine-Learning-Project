2020-05-17T01:07:00+10:00 : I've never had much luck with shares but they are never blue chips so I sold all of what I have in other small riskier companies and put all my eggs in one blue chip NAB basket. (12,000 shares @ $120 a cent @ $9.50 per trade ). my intention is to sell on short term highs and buy in on short term lows according to the NAB charts. I'm also prepared to lose the lot if NAB go into liquidation as I'm used to that scenario from my many other bad ASX investments.
