2020-05-04T21:57:00+10:00 : appalling but McEwan and McKeon have a history of that (CBA, RBS and AMP times refer)? Why did APRA let McEwan and McKeon be the CEO and NED respectively?APRA is as much to blame as NAB, the sycophantic board, the shareholders, the industry funds and McEwan/ Mc Keon themselves IMHO?
