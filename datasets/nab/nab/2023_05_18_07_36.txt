I'm well aware there is a difference between RBA cash rate and mortgage rates.my mortgage rate is currently 5.8%much lower than it was in 2008 - 2009current mortgage rates are not high historically.     they have risen from ridiculously low levels.I'll bet I own more CBA shares than most people, so you are incorrect that I don't own bank shares.don't make assumptions about people.NAB, forget it.
