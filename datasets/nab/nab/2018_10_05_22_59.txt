2018-10-05T22:59:00+10:00 : $26 would give us a a fully franked yield of 7.8 percent fully franked that is highly unlikely to drop very far unless we get a major economic downturn and even then NAB is well capitalized. They might get that low but considering the ex dividend date is coming up I would expect them to get to around $28.50 in the short term. In the medium term I think we are going to be floating within this $27-32 range for the forseeable future.
