2024-05-02T09:45:00+10:00 : Looks like a pretty fair result with no real surprises in tougher conditions. Fairly close to consensus on most things, NIMs slightly down due to competitive pressure but close to expectations.Provisions show no major blow out but there is a deterioration in arrears. Slight increase to dividend which was expected to stay flat and buy back increased another $1.5b which is long term good.Capital management is front and centre as it should be.Wouldn't expect a significant move in SP either way compared to peers. Business as usual in what is a mature sector (which some don't seem to grasp)(Hopefully analysis can be replied here and leave the howling at the moon to the money laundering thread others are so keen to keep at the top)
