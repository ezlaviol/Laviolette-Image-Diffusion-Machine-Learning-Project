Who needs prevention when you can stay on tablets permanently? The worst IMO is the acupuncturists where they were registered for "safety" meanwhile the government has allowed dry needling (acupuncture by another name) to take over with a weekend short course and zero set standards. But nobody cares-well not until their lungs collapse. Having personally worked in the hospital system here I can say the Drs are not all that highly paid considering the years of study and obscene hecs debts compared to the rest of the world. Hospital management on the other hand? well.... Dyor All IMO.
