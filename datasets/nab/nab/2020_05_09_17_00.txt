You have to put in a I or X in front of the 10 digit number for it to accept. If I does not work put in x. When that is accepted the next page will ask you to confirm your full name and address they have on record. Once you confirm that information the next page will be a custom bill pay reference that you print out and then just pay whatever pre determined amount they allow just as you would paying a utility bill. Because the amount will be higher than you usually pay dont be supprised if your bank asks to confirm who you are by asking you one of the security questions you answered when setting up your account. I hope this info helps you.Good luck, I put though for the full amount. Lets see how they determine the scale back.
