You must have held some NAB shares on 24 April.If there is not 100% demand for the SPP then you can buy up to $30,000 at $14.15 (At the rate SP is going, well, you can ignore the doomsayers on other Threads ...  I'd like to scrape up the cash and buy 30000 worth but doubt  I'll be allowed to)Likelihood (IMO) there'll be an allocation based on the number of shares held at April 24.   DYOR
