2020-03-09T20:02:00+11:00 : DOW Futues are down 1200 points. See what happens overnight. Oil has been going down because Russia and the Saudis are having a tiff and the DOW is oil company centric.I pulled my order for $20. I will buy tomorrow - as you say, quality investment and the falls have nothing to do with company operations. Another 50 cents off will still make it a very good buy.Think the SP will drop early tomorrow so buying before lunch could get an even bigger discount. $25-26 is at the low range of a fair SP for NAB - still think $30 is where it should be under normal circumstances.
