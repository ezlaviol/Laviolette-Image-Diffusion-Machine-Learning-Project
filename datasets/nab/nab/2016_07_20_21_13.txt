NAB better get a wriggle on or ANZ SP will overtake it soon, and that would never do .
You are correct. We better aim for $30.

I have no ammo left anyhow (for the moment); I have been naughty and spraying it everywhere outside the ASX20. I have always been a bit trigger happy. I must say I am not that happy with mi (Li)ttle friend; I do not like the way it is trading. It better get its act together. I see why you like the banks; they are too big to be played down or up. Unfortunately some of the other stuff is so shiny and golden I just could not resist (Lurkin would be proud; or not. I think he called me dumb last time he posted here; as you can imagine I was shattered).
