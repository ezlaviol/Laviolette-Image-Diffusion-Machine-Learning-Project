2017-07-19T13:53:00+10:00 : Well as I said yesterday I was waiting on this. I jumped in for another 1,000 shares just a second ago. Will see where the market goes for my final 1,000 to complete my NAB holdings.

This is good news, but of course at the mercy of the US markets which are in my opinion too high!!! Regardless the poor sentiment on banks over the last few months have been on potentially large capital raisings, which now, have no eventuated.
