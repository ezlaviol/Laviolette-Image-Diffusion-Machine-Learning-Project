Who gave you that incorrect piece of information?They go however audit Star Entertainment Group and that is not a good look for NAB as afflicted as it is with money laundering scandals in both NZ and Australia over the years.RBNZ and AUSTRAC will eventually take notice. The lack of provision is a serious problem for NAB IMHO.
