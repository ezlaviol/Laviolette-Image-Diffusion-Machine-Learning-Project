It's the yield that matters most because only a reduced dividend can stop you doubling your original investment over ten years, even if the SP drops. Having taken a long term view (I.e. at least 10 yrs) you can be very confident that you will have the chance to sell at or above your entry price at some point - you might decide to exit after nine years if the price is (say) $45 or you might need to sit in a little longer if the price is depressed in 10 yrs, simply sit in long enough for it to rebound and provided you have a LT view this shouldn't be an issue.
