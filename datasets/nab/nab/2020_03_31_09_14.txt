2020-03-31T09:14:00+11:00 : You have a habit of cherry picking issues, deflecting your position and not looking at the broader picture. 
It is ludicrous to suggest there is no money in broadcasting sport, whether pay to view or funded by advertising revenue and broadcast rights will still have a value and of course the sports then have to operate within their income constraints. If that requires a reduction in player payments or club staff numbers then so be it.
I think you confuse some of the sports, however I was only referring to AFL and NRL.
(Super Rugby has its own issues and heading down a pretty dark path prior to this.)  
It is bizarre and irrelevant to suddenly start saying the banks should be giving lines of credit to DV etc. Have they asked for these lines of credit?? Considering most of these types of organisations are Government funded it does not seem an issue for them to be arranging large commercial deals
Your innuendo appears to be that the banks neglect their social responsibilities which I believe is totally unfounded and unfair. All the banks give very significant amounts of money to various social bodies and have done for a very long time. It is rarely something bank bashers wish to acknowledge.
Assistance to tenants and landlords etc is a totally different issue and I am amazed that you don't understand that handling of these issues is not dependant on each other
