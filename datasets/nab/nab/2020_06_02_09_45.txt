Booklet clearly states list of dates. Long story short, you will get your allocation today, be able to trade tomorrow. Everyone eligible got the minimum amount $2500. Anything more than this is based on your holdings prior. Please take the time to read the information provided and make an informed financial decision. ( Who am I kidding, people wont read the booklet, they cant even be bothered reading that this has been answered numerous time on this forum already )
