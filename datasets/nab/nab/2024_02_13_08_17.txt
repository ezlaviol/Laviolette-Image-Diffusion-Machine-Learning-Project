Issuing subordinated notes like it is going out of fashion to get their CET 1 ratio down, NAB might have to do a rights issue especially if they get a big regulatory fine out of the BNZ troubles with RBNZ or the NAB troubles with AUSTRAC.They have done their bank branch closures so there is little headroom other than dishing out subordinated notes, rights issues and trying to get their CET 1 ratio under control.
