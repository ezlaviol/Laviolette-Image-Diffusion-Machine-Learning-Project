2017-11-03T10:33:00+11:00 : I bought another 1,000 today for the dividend at $31.75. Was going to buy this or WBC post dividend but NAB has fallen a lot prior to ex divi. I expect a recovery as the general market sentiment is up as well. $1.98 plus f/c is a yield of 8.86%. So long as housing doesn't crash and burn this is a bargain. WBC/CBA have the most housing exposure anyway and NAB is our smallest bank in the portfolio. Figured best to top up. Will see if I'm an idiot
