2019-02-21T12:29:00+11:00 : Sorry to burst your bubble Sircorp. Here is some info for you:NAB net profit 2018 - 5.6 Billion during a year on which a royal commission was being conductedSo your telling me with the money that NAB made 5600M you don't want to pay the CEO or driver of the bus 20M - 0.003% of the total?Also more to note:They are performance rights - ie if the company isn't up to par with profit and growth they will not receive them or only partially receive them.Secondary note: People forget that after the first $180,000 of incomeÂ almost half or 47% is tax. So when you see that 20M your better of saying that he will actually only take home 10M net of tax. It might be even less if labor get in:Base wage would be over 180kIf you look at those given stocks - cost base $0Pay tax on 75% of the profit so if 20M in performance rights sold that tax on 15M @47% - 7M tax with take home 8M.Why are you always so doom and gloom?
