2020-05-22T07:07:00+10:00 : vagabond, my 15-20% estimate is based on:- 7% shareholder participation rate in last year's WBC spp (when there wasn't 6 million people on job keeper allowance lacking $$ to buy shares  I.e. no economic recession then)- 15% shareholder participation in the 2009 CBA spp (mathematically inferred)The cochlear spp had a higher participation rate because the market price was was trading 30% higher during the last week of the application period, so it was a massive near 30% stag....and it still didn't attract the majority of shareholders to participate. The 2009 ANZ spp had 40% shareholder participation rate but once again, there wasn't 6 million people on job keeper lacking dollars, with a potential w recovery (Q4 may be a blood bath again),  and it had a slightly higher stag than this current NAB spp.
