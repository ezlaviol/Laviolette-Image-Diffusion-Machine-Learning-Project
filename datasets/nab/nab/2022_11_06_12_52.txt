2022-11-06T12:52:00+11:00 : Disgusting, so has NAB a forced all customers to supply evidence of their permanent residence and or citizenship of Australia?You would hope NAB was no longer banking “skilled” visa holders and “student” visa holders after all the human trafficking reports in Nick McKenzie’s 60 Monutes AUstralia report, The Age and SMH articles.The amount of human trafficking, prostitution and pornography services mixed up in Australia’s banking system looks absolutely horrendous.60 Minutes AUstralia could have a real impact if they continue to gather evidence of this. The banks, the banking regulator and the Government including NAB need to atone for all this human trafficking they are facilitating and freeze the assets of the pimps and prostitutes IMHO but pls DYODD.
