We all have skeletons in our closet. Seeing it's just us though I will come clean. But don't tell anyone  

Cba, Nab, BOQ, tcl, tls all good. 
Pls has potential but quite red at the moment. There's no column for potential in my portfolio listing though! 
Caj, hav, sau not so good. Caj really,  really red and has done nothing for months. It's like watching paint dry. Sau was doing ok but decided to drop 15% today out of the blue so now red as well .

Now you know all my little secrets .
