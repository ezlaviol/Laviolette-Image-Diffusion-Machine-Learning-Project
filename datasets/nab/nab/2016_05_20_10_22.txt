2016-05-20T10:22:00+10:00 : I wouldn't read too much into the volatility of NAB... market noise

This is all about dividend yield and right now it's going to yield plenty compared to cash in the bank.. the only reason to sell is on a profit warning or some global financial market problems.. as long as NAB maintains the highest dividend payout / cash profit ratio, I'll stay...

Of all the banks, which all carry the inherent risk of exposure to the housing market, I think NAB is the leanest and meanest and seems to have waltzed through the dramas afflicting the other big three

Growth is a concern of course but for this investment class, stability is more important
