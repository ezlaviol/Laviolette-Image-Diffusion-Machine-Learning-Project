Another way to look at this would be,... can I say,... since this bank has a dividend policy,... even if we have gone in at a high price, the time will soon come that we can break even due to the dividend that we will be receiving,... provided we hold the counter long enough and do not sell out !
But of course, everybody would want to be able to go in at the right price, with a good margin of safety. However, even if one does not,... he will soon breakeven after, say,... a few years.
