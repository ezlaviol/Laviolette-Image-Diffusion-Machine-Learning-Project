2020-06-02T15:18:00+10:00 : So you only had 206 shares and you got 176 at $14,15. You were allocated at about 85% of your holding. Most with a larger level of shares only got 28% of their holding and people with more than 7500 share got a lesser perecentage . I can't see you have anything to complain about.
