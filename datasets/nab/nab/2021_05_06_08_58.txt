this is one of my long term holdings
and may I suggest
its amazing with div reinvest how your wealth grows
year in year out

ps I've been a holder for.......ummm lets say over 30 years
we started with a very little investment, added a little here and there and div reinvest did the rest
and coupled to the franking credit 

this has built a nice.... little amount $

something young people should think seriously about
