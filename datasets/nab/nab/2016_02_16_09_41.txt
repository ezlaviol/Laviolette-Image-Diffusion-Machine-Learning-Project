2016-02-16T09:41:00+11:00 : Tuesday, 16 February 2016 ASX Announcement NAB 2016 First Quarter Trading Update Improved business results and successful CYBG separation

Key points The quarterly average of the September 2015 Half Year results for continuing operations is used for comparison purposes unless otherwise stated.
 Unaudited cash earnings for continuing operations (which excludes CYBG PLC (CYBG)) were approximately $1.7 billion for the December 2015 quarter, which is approximately 3% above the quarterly average of the September 2015 Half Year result and approximately 8% up on the prior corresponding period.
 On a statutory basis, unaudited net profit attributable to the owners of the Company for the December 2015 quarter was approximately $1.5 billion.
The main difference between statutory and cash earnings relates to fair value and hedge ineffectiveness, elimination of treasury shares, and sale and demerger costs consistent with previous disclosures.
 On a cash earnings for continuing operations basis (which excludes CYBG):
 Revenue increased approximately 2%. Excluding a legal settlement gain in the September 2015 half year, revenue rose approximately 4% benefitting from improved lending volumes, a higher net interest margin (NIM), and stronger Wealth results.
Group NIM increased reflecting benefits of home loan repricing partly offset by higher funding costs and competition for business lending.
 Expenses increased approximately 5%. The result was impacted by the timing of higher personnel costs, largely related to Enterprise Bargaining Agreement salary increases and redundancy costs associated with project completions.
Current expectations are for FY16 cash expense growth for continuing operations, and excluding currency impacts, to be less than FY15 expense growth of 4.1%1 .
 The charge for Bad and Doubtful Debts (B&DDs) for the quarter fell 52% to $84 million.

The key driver was lower charges in Australian Banking due to improved asset quality and the non-repeat of the Australian mining and agri overlay top-up in the September 2015 half year.

 The Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.1% as at 31 December 2015, compared with 10.2% at 30 September 2015 reflecting the impact of the final 2015 dividend declaration.
The Group’s CET1 target ratio remains 8.75% – 9.25%.
 The Group’s leverage ratio as at 31 December 2015 was 5.4% on an APRA basis.
 The Group’s quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) as at 31 December 2015 was 119%.
