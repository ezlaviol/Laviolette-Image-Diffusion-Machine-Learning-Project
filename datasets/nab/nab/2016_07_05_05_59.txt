2016-07-05T05:59:00+10:00 : I'm out of all except banks now. Got my eye on a nice mud cake from a local bakery. GL on a PLS run, the future looks good. Election, ugh what a joke. NAB today and a very nice payday. Still looking for a BOQ turn. Bit of a shake yesterday and shorts have fallen right off. Almost grabbed some more but decided to start on the others. Can't believe into the second half of 16 already. Too much time spent watching moving numbers I can tell you
