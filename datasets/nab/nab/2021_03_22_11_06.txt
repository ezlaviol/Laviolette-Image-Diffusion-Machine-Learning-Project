2021-03-22T11:06:00+11:00 : I think NAB has more potential  There is nothing much more they can do. The 86400 take over enable them to compete with the likes of ING through the use of their wholesale advantedge platform. Ubank Home loans is not as good. Because of customers "input" 86400 has brokers to "tidy" up the home loan for the now NAB to approve. Which is Good. They will soon need to follow other banksMerge up their Business division with Residential. Cut more business bankers. Outsource to brokers. No need for overhead. Cut cost like Westpac.Go into Buy now Pay Later space and Crush the likes of AFT push AFT overseas. the Banks here can do whatever they want here in OZ. They could form a coalition like ETFPOS for the BNPL space. Cut more Branches. Cut off docklands Office. MLC was gone. Which is good. The last squeeze to $29 should be more on the safe side, over $30 I might have doubts.
