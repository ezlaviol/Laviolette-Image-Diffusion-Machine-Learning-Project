2020-03-28T16:39:00+11:00 : Sadly things are changing at alarming rate, impossible to know what will happen even tomorrow...What was valid on Friday will not be Valid on Monday that's why we are seeing staggering Volatility in Market...One thing sure, Smaller Banks need to recapitalize (BEN, SUN, BOQ, VUK etc), they were already under stress (very low margin & loosing customers to big banks), now Capital Raising only option for them. Big four will survive, small one I doubt all of them will survive. ..Most likely NAB & WBC, ANZ will give No Dividend, None What so Ever. That way, big four don;t need to recapitalise at all.
