Please do research first in regards to Arrium lenders.

Last month, ANZ revealed a $100 million-plus increase in its provisioning for potential bad debts, and it is understood that Arrium and Peabody were the two main factors in that rise.
However, the ABC also understands that ANZ has the smallest exposure to Arrium of the big four.
The major banks are collectively offering the company a $400 million loan lifeline to keep operating, but it is believed the conditions include the big four getting a say in which company is appointed as voluntary administrator of Arrium and receiving security for the loan. from abc link: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-06/arrium-shares-suspended-ahead-of-lender-announcement/7303192

maybe that was the reason behind the pull back today,
