That’s great.. I bought a million shares of OBJ @7.2c and sold at 5.8 or something. A blessing considering their 2c sp now.
My intention was that they would double in price and provide massive capital gain..

Guess what, you and I had intentions that didn’t play out because what we thought would happen didn’t although for you things might still work out.

Everything changes, especially if governments have anything to do with it.
