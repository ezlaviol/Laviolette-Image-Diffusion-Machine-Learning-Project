2016-06-02T20:52:00+10:00 : I am getting excited 
All banks dropping. BEN dropped 5.6% coming into dividend ! Could drop further 
Hands getting itchy, but still sore after the smack the other day. 
So many choices. 
Only problem is futures in the US are almost positive and banks in London are up.  could ruin the master plan.
