2020-05-21T18:07:00+10:00 : I just bpay $20k ,  hopefully I get it all.When I find out what allotment I got, I will then sell my current handful of NAB shares (which I purchased 2 months ago, currently break even) Do you guys know find out what allotment we get on 27 May,  or 2 June ?    The booklet states SPP results announced 27 May.  Is that when we find out how much was raised?cheers,Alan
