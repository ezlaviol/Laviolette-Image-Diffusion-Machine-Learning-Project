2020-05-20T20:57:00+10:00 : I have a slightly different slant on that. I think the banks SP's for example are close - if not there - to their low point $14-16 is a really low price for NAB - it is possibly true that we could see these levels for most of 2020.In regard to the economy, it really depends on whether the government will go hard to get the economy kick started or they start to pull back too much. Any stimulus actually helps the banks as there is more activity.Australia will have issues with any embargoes but they will targeted. Most damaging will be in education as universities now rely heavily on overseas students and a lot of those come from China. We know the barkey industry will be hit hard but even there, there won't be lasting damage - farmers will grow different grains and new markets will be found - India seems to be the name that comes up. Wineries might also get a kicking.Upshot is that there are rumblings about getting an industrial base that Australia used to have (20% of employment versus 6% now). Chinese exports to Australia will go down as a  result.So, doom and gloom is maybe over done. If I had spare capital now, I would be buying bank shares. I would do so knowing that I may not see any real capital growth for 6-12 months and maybe 12 months before there are increases in dividends. I would also know that there would be serious longer term gains.

Of more importance is the opinion whether the NAB share price will suffer if these embargoes proceed.I'm of the opinion that if the economy flattens out after the stumulus packages end, and this is followed by several embargoes on selected goods, then the SP may well go below the current offering, and this is not even looking at other economic issues which may surface.in this case it may well be better to wait and see before diving in....    opinions welcome
