Its a pretty poor announcement as its just says offers will be scaled back without presenting a graph of how they are going to calculate it. Why make today the day to give us details of scaleback without putting up a calculator so we can see the method they are going to use. I have never seen another company make such a poor ASX announcement in a SPP scaleback.
