2016-06-19T00:44:00+10:00 : I ran a few numbers and came to the conclusion that even if the divvy was reduced by (say) 5c - a 10c annual reduction - it had only a small impact on % yield, still remained well over 7%.

Psychologically it would probably dent the share price more substantially and probably all banks would head south if one of the big four cut the divvy.
