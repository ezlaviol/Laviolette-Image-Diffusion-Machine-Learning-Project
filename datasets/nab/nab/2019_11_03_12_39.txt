Buy and Hold and be happy , nothing i say will help you unless you are willing to change and be proactive . A tax bill is no reason not to sell and thats the reasoning of most B & H  . If your B&H is higher on the right than the left keep holding but NAB is not that stock  contrary to popular opinion .
