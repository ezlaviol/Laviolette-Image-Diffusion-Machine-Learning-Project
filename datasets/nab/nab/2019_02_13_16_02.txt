2019-02-13T16:02:00+11:00 : Ozzie property prices are absurdly high to me but not so to the Chinese happy to pay US3 million for a shoe box in Shanghai or Hong Kong.Stop deluding yourself. Property is not crashing.We live in the luckiest/best country in the world.Â Our population is expected to double in the next 20 years.Simple demographics ensures that any dip in prices will be aggressively bid.A 10-20% correction at best. NAB has bottomed. Short term target $26.00 - $26.50.
