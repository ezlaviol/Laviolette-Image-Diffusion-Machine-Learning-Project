NAB hit $36 in '06 & went on to $45 in '07. In the last 15 years, this mob has had more screw-ups than an NRL team. In the interim, they've blown up enough shareholders funds to pay off the national debt. And yes, I do hold some(for my sins, & the dividends). So don't get too excited, they're still trying to extricate themselves from the mess they've got in the UK.
