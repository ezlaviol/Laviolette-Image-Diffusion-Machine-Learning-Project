2017-05-30T12:17:00+10:00 : You realise of course that your initial advice to buy 10,000 NAB shares requires an initial punt of around $300K. When it went down again the next day (because you got it wrong) you advised to "buy more" (another $150-$300K?) so are you now sitting in NAB with $450K-$600K of shares hoping for your "guaranteed" $1 per share or is this all just pretend trading and fantasy talk?

Let us know because I'm getting a bit tired of these expert trading calls without any skin in the game.
