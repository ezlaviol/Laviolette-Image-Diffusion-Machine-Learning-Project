2016-07-12T13:22:00+10:00 : I hold banks but as I have said time and after again. I welcome a GFC-like event. To be honest, it will happen. Shares are just not fair value, particularly in the USA. Just check the P/E Shillings Ratio for confirmation. It will crash. But it is impossible to pick a bottom. Therefore, just have cash, and perhaps some good debt prepared should hell unfold.
