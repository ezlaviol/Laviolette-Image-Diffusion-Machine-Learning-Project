I think @Nanood 's article has a very good point (among the noise like most articles).  There's too much pessimism at the moment for us to be at the top. Everyone is scared of their own shadow and there is a lot of caution and over reaction to any news. This is not the mentality of an overpriced market, generally speaking imo.  Having said that, maybe this is the exception to the rule, so who knows? 

One thing I do know. A sure way of not making money is to do nothing.
