It is astonishingly stupid how pessimistic the market is on the four major banks, alll four have been massively oversold based on peculiar proxies and comparisons of global bank capital ratios. No accounting standard and capital standard is the same anymore, Australians should recognise. ASX invvestors/ traders might eventually realise that after some of us have made money from their selling IMHO but pls DYOR.

If the FED was perceived to have carried on like the APRA is perceived, then it would be an issue for the President or in Australia, the PM. APRA's behaviors should be a political issue but it seems property owners r just silently making their money and getting their mortgages (at slightly higher rates).

The Aussie Home Loan (a mortgage broker subsidiary of CBA) boss, John Symonds, pointed out in Fairfax on-line that Australians are now at a disadvantage to foreigners in buying property in Sydney and Melbourner because they are subject to more lending restrictions. Even despite that unfairness, the banks in Australia are in a really sweet spot within the global economy.

Betting against property rises in Sydney and Melbourne is courageous beyond the common sense that a lot of the Asian/ global population would love to work or learn or jjust get a foothold (usually through education) in either Sydney and/or Melbourne. Will they not ccome anymore? Will the Immigration Restriction Act ccome back in?What are these things that give rise to the pessimism? It is pretty hard to follow. I fear that the people betting against the banks actually visited Sydney and/or Melbourne, they might just buy a property financed by a less well capitalised foreign bank such as C (Citi), HSBC or BoC, ICBC.
