"National Australia Bank will continue to hold its standard variable rate for home loans at 5.24 per cent," the bank said in a statement on its website. 	Commonwealth Bank of Australia  (CBA) , Westpac Banking Corporation  (WBC)  and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  (ANZ)  all already hiked their rates, citing higher funding costs.
