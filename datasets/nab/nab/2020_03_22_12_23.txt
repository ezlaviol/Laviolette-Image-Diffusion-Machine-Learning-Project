2020-03-22T12:23:00+11:00 : I am alarmed about my dividends (money to live on) getting suspended buit what really scares me is the idea that I am going to get a tap on my shoulder for more capital. I am quietly praying that the bad debts are contained or the lock downs are only say six months long and that businesses recover and bounce back.  If small businesses can not make it back to at least meet their costs higher bad debts will eraser capital backing and lead to capital raisings to meet Basel  Capital adequacy requirements.
