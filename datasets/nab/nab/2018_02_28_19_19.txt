Indeed Great minds think alike for sure haha.

I took profits today on WPL at $29.02 which obviously was a bit early but I was happy with 2% ex brokerage. Still think it’s a great buy but I wanted to move on.

I then bought in to HVN at $3.94 with those funds hoping for a rebound so fingers crossed tomorrow is green as well but happy so far with this trade.

At the same time I bought TLS at $3.37 and initially it went up but then ended the day slightly lower but that’s ok I think I got it at a decent price and don’t see a lot more downside - expecting a rebound to $3.40 in the coming days.

Bit worried about DMP, looking weak so it’ll obviously be more of a medium term hold now clearly. Fairly confident it’ll rebound but not sure when.

I’m keeping a close eye on NCM, QBE & also RHC after today’s selloff - I like all of them again for rebounds but can’t have them all lol.

Cheers
