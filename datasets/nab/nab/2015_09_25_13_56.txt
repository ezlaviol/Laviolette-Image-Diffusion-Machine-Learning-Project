2015-09-25T13:56:00+10:00 : Well Drummo i watched a webinar presso  last night by Fat Profits and NAB was the only bank from the top 4 with a BUY recommendation mainly due to the UK spin-off as u say. They were not so sure about the other 3 wondering where their growth would come from especially CBA.

I received the webinar as a promotional thingy and can not post the link etc etc.
