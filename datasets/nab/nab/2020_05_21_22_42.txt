There's enough of a premium here (~10%) to make even the minimum $5k offer worthwhile, since that would equate to a quick $500 profit. Quick glance at a couple of recent SPP's would indicate 20% is a low estimate. Cochlear's SPP had a 45% participation rate with average application value of $25k. Flight Centre's had a participation rate of 67%. 20% participation really does seem a bit low, in my view.
