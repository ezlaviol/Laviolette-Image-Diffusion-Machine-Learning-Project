2016-03-01T16:33:00+11:00 : I've been through every crash, recession,(that we had to have),GFC, Grexit, PIGS, Tech wreck and what ever name you want to put a handle on in the last 35 years and believe me they can't put a handle on this one because this one is called MANIPULATION. The market is a clever inception to take money from the impatient and give it to the patient. ... When this becomes apparent the market will turn very quickly. What is this stock missing that was there 12 months ago????????
