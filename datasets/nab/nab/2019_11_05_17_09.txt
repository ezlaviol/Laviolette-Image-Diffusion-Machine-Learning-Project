2019-11-05T17:09:00+11:00 : Interesting conundrum, isn't it? Do people hold waiting for the dividend announcement in the hope the SP stabilises (and it has bounced back this week a bit) or do you off-load in the expectation that the dividend will be cut, CR announced and the SP gets walloped.I recall that NAB did the hard thing last time - cutting dividends (and the formula for calculating them), credit raising. I do really suspect that NAB may have held up a lot more than pundits expect and the ANZ/WBC have.I'll take the punt and hold for now.

The Australian Newspaper reports that it’s likely NAB and ANZ will have to raise capital, and NAB may do so on Thursday. Like WBC, they need more capital buffers to meet regulatory requirements going forward.Will wait now til Thursday to see results and forecast on capital requirements.
