I was just trying to ask some rational questions in regard to your post which I note mirrors voting suggestion on another bank.Trying to understand your reply, I gather the main issue is you are not happy with NAB's capital management strategy over past couple of years, however I did not see any comment in your proposal in regard alternate directors but you still claim it is not simply a protest voteGive me some details on options and I may join you in voting to oust the current Directors! Perhaps you didn't read my post fully!Curiously there was also no comment in regard to the reason for voting Against the Constitution change proposal (Res 4)I often find this is a trigger issue however most don't read the details to understand what is being proposed. (I am sure you have and just wish to not divulge the reason you found we should not approve - pity, knowledge is power)Anyway, as I stressed, I always advocate holders should read info in full and being fully informed, vote as they see fit. I was not trying in any way to influence votes just trying to provide some info and perspective. This is HC of course, I should know better..............
