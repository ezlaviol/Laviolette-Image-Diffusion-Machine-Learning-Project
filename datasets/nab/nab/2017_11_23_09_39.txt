Sorry JCoure but that was an absolute rubbish statement. Firstly a Royal Commission in to Banking is far from done, looking likely but definately not a given.

Secondly, as if a Royal Commission would solely look at NAB as a "newbie" (whatever you actually mean by that) and not worry about any of the other Banks.....You cannot be serious LOL. Like they are going to say let's not worry about the other banks in to a royal commission let's just concentrate on NAB only because there's nothing else to see at CBA, ANZ & WBC lol lol

Finally, you assume a royal commission finding(s) will be negative and have far reaching consequences.....Do not assume anything as it's likely to be political rather than anything else ASSUMING it even gets up to start with.
