Will the day ever come when NAB  actually tells shareholders exactly what they are up to and what stupidities they have managed to get themselves involved in?I hope it is not some disgruntled shareholder going on a rampage.  Or it could be some victim of NAB stupidities getting revenge.  There is no end to it.
