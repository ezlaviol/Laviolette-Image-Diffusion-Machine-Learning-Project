It's also presented some wonderful accumulation opportunities for long term holders.I have bought and sold along the way but current average price is $25.Underlying business is in great shape IMO.Edit: (My quotes don't appear to be working of late) Was responding to Giz's post: "What a perenial underperformer, I hope a new CEO can change the prospects of this dog."
