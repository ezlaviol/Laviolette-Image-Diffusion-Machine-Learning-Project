2018-11-05T14:53:00+11:00 : If nab drops to $14 without a crash in overall markets, I would be worried
Management are hiding some very bad news, but that's just me
If dow were to fall 50% sure if nab crashes like the rest of the banks would Im buying, but if nab were to be the only bank to keep falling and falling to new 52 week lows all the time, I'd be concerned
