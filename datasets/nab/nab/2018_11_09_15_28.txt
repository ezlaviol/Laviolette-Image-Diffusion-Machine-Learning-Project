2018-11-09T15:28:00+11:00 : 2 cents.
ANZ & WBC haven’t gone exdiv yet so support. CBA produced a good update so support. NAB is ex div and nothing else to go on for support. It also has a VWAP period for DRP calculated between the 13th to the 21st Nov so it may be manipulated to achieve a lower price. It’s conspiracy theory stuff but I take it into consideration.

Best option IMO, take a nibble if you think its good value. If it drops you have capital. If it rises yr in profit.

That maybe worth less than 2c. Maybe nothing at all
