2016-06-16T20:08:00+10:00 : I am looking to get 4000 shares if it goes through $24. I am looking for a few days that it doesn't go any lower with the 2 moving average lines diverging. I'm not thinking there's any urgency to jump in yet since there doesn't seem to be any pressure to drive the share price up except for bargain hunters jumping in then the down trend continues. It's just recently gone ex div. so could stay low for the next month or so, just my opinion. It might get to mid $23, but then that would be a bargain even if overseas markets have gone to pieces, if that happens then everyone will dump NAB and who knows how low it will go!
