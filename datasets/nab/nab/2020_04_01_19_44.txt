NAB has fallen mighty fast without any evidence to support the issues that may befall it.Wuhan virus has not yet created that much mayhem. Australia has little inner cities like NYC, Detroit, Seattle, EUropean cities like Madrid and Milan so how it was ever going to have this much effect in Sydney. melbourne and Auckland is beyond me.NAB has been oversold. IMHO FOMO time not FONGO.Change my sentiment back to buy from hold.
