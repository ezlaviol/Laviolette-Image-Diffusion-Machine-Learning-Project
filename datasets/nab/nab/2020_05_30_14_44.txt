2020-05-30T14:44:00+10:00 : Looking at the complication of reconciling of last few years share buy/sell and calculate loss or profit, is it good idea to sell everything and then buy again (if needed)...That way I will start with a clean slate for next year. No drama of matching buy/sell....(Last year, my accountant charged me several hundred dollars extra as she (?) wanted to verify transaction (confirmation date vs which year they were adjusted for sell or buy)
