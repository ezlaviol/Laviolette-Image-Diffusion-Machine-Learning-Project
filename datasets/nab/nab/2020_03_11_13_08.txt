Stimulus package is dubious value against an actual pandemic with people in hospital and dying.  Vaccine will be a minimum of 12 months. Coronavirus in my mind is much greater than any outbreak since the Spanish flu and maybe worse than that.Now that I got that off my chest.  I think the bank will recover in time and is a good buy.  It may be a better buy in 3 months though.  I have no doubt that in 2-3 years it will be well up.Only my opinion, I am happy to be proved wrong.
