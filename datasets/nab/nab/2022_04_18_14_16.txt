2022-04-18T14:16:00+10:00 : NAB has had the biggest recovery in share price since the new CEO was appointed however new shareholders don't seem to be aware of the $billions lost by shareholder cash raising to cover $billion fines, & more billions in previous deals gone wrong over last 30 years Homeside Inc in USA was a disaster, then the Clydesdale/Yorkshire Bank (CYBG) disaster in UK. MLC Life etc.Their best deal was buying Custom Credit  Corporation in 1980 approx but they killed that off instead of staying in the consumer finance business. It was once said of the NAB that Custom Credit staff had taken over the management of the Bank when the rivers of profits were coming from CCC with Bank profit increases of 15% per year not uncommon back in the earlier 1980's but I am very surprised that in its Banking Heritage History the NAB fails to make any mention of Custom Credit Corporation and Google are not much help either.https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F1991-03-14%2F0122%22https://pinpoint.cch.com.au/document/legauUio2981585sl957757217/custom-credit-corporation-limited-in-liquidation-v-various-debtors-vichttps://theconversation.com/national-australia-bank-30-years-of-strategy-failure-55159
