2023-05-04T11:10:00+10:00 : May 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell on Thursday for a third consecutive session, with financials leading the decline, as worries about the global economic health cautioned investors, while National Australia Bank dropped after posting a sour outlook. 	The S&P/ASX 200 index  (xjo)  fell 0.6% to 7,150.3 points by 0045 GMT. The benchmark fell 1% on Wednesday. 	The financial index  .AXFJ  slumped as much as 3.8% â€” its worst day in more than two months. National Australia Bank, Australia's second-largest, dragged the sub-index lower after warning of headwinds to domestic home lending.	  	Shares of the bank fell as much as 8.1%, to see their worst day in more than three years.  	The other three "Big Banks" also dropped within the range of 2.8% and 3.4%. 	Globally, investors felt jittery after the Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points as expected, even as the U.S. central bank considered a pause in its rate hike path in the coming months.	 	The energy sector  .AXEJ  slipped around 0.5%, after investors fretted about a weakening global economy that could possibly dilute demand for energy. 	Sector majors Woodside Energy  (WDS)  and Santos  (STO)  fell 0.8% and 0.1%. 	Meanwhile, the gold index  .AGD  rose about 2.5%, which countered some losses in the benchmark, as investors sought protection in the safe-haven asset.  	Newcrest Mining  (NCM)  and Northern Star Resources  .NST.AX  gained about 1.3% and 4%, respectively. 	The mining  .AXMM  and tech  .AXIJ  index traded about 1% and 0.3% higher.   	New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index  (nz50)  fell about 0.1% to 11,894.1 points.
