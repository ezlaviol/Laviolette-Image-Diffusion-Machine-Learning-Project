We are enduring a ride through unknown territory at the moment and it is difficult to judge what will happen when things normalise.NAB's SP should go up today on the back of gains in the US overnight.

Ross McEwen and Simon McKeon will no doubt do for NAB what they did for RBS and AMP, employee numbers will go down, bank SP will go down, bank will shrink and sholders IMHO will suffer while they receive more money.
