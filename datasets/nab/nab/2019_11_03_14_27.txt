2019-11-03T14:27:00+11:00 : I am not sure what you are explaining - and I have been asking but getting no straight answer.I hold the shares because I get a reasonably income from them - can't see that is a bad strategy to have a couple of income shares and chase capital gains with a few others. Need some diversity.Not sure what you are on about with the tax angle at all. I don't invest to make a loss so a tax off-set s not an issue with me personally. I won't be selling them is there is no valid reason put forward to do that.

Forget it i am not explaining anymore , people looking for confirmation bias are not going to listen to anything i have to say  . Buy and Hold and be happy , nothing i say will help you unless you are willing to change and be proactive . A tax bill is no reason not to sell and thats the reasoning of most B & H  . If your B&H is higher on the right than the left keep holding but NAB is not that stock  contrary to popular opinion .
