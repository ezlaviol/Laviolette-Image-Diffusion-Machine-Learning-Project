Second, it could turn at any time, and then it’s already too late to buy. When a company’s share price falls because of company specific weakness, Cash bleeding, huge losses, no future prospects and so on then it is nothing but catching a falling knife. In NAB’s case, not so much. It has a very bright future. I am an owner since much higher prices than today’s (average $24) and I am still very happy with my entry price. That says it all, I guess.
