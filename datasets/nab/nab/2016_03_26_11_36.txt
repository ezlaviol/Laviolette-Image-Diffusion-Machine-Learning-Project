Here are some reasons:

1. The world economy is stuffed and it is foolhardy imo to believe we will escape this. 

2. What happens if property prices start to fall?

3. What happens if unemployment increases to the folks who have used low interest rates to take out massive loans and pay record prices for their homes? (Let's dare not think about interest rates rising.)

4. Surely we have quite a few major businesses that will be going bankrupt.

5. Does anyone really know the details of NAB's phenomenally massive derivatives portfolio? With many banks a 1% or 2% mark to market loss on their derivatives portfolio makes them effectively bankrupt.

6. Banks these days are basically gambling - they have moved away from traditional banking and use highly leveraged means to trade currencies, commodities ... you name it....
