2021-03-28T15:50:00+11:00 : Westpac Merging Business and Resi divisionand now selling New Zealand "division" Insurance to Allianz. ANOTHER 48 branches closed! Westpac. What is NAB doing for us? If they don't start cutting cost because we all know the margins are being squeezed! We must well JUMP ship to Westpac! "they Westpac" still got a huge bunch of "cina" Home loans collecting 6%+ in Home loans rates, Correct me if I am wrong. those that did the "overseas" income thingy. Highly profitable. Because That bunch of people cannot refinance anymore. What is left now? lol If NAB can hasten the move in New Zealand could be a First Mover Advantage. Merging Business Division and Residential Division is inevitable.Talking all this poo what's the use? you could just say shoo me to Westpac. End of the day. I still like Nab better lol Just hoping we are not so far behind. Nab throughout the years trading and investing made me a lot of $$$$ Let's hope it stays that way. Just Love trading banksters!
