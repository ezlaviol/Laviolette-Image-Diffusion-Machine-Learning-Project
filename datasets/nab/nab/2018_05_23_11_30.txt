2018-05-23T11:30:00+10:00 : For people who remember when NAB took over Custom.Credit and in view of some allegations coming out of R.C can it be now implied that most departments of our banks have really been acting as hard line finance companies or would investors expect banks to act in this manner anyway to protect both depositors and shareholder interests?

Also can we also assume that with Ken Henry wanting to change the culture at NAB that maybe NAB no longer has the growth and other market prospects it once had in the banking sector unless  banks in general can find another ESANDA or Custom Credit to gain that profitability and growth momentum assuming the usury style management is suddenly going to change at the banks like NAB?
