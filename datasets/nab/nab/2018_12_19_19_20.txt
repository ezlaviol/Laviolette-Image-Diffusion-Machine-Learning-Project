2018-12-19T19:20:00+11:00 : Resolution 3 relating to the VR shares was overwhelmingly defeated at the AGM. The vote on this was 64% against, and 34% in favour. Thorburn however will still receive his reward, except that it will now be paid to him as cash. He will also receive the $ equivalent of future dividends that otherwise would have flowed under the shares. Will this however be with franking added in (doubled up), or without franking? They simply have not learnt anything form out of today's meeting. The shareholders were disgusted and neither the CEO nor the Chair were humble in respect of the shareholder wealth destruction that they have collectively presided over. Whilst to some, the NAB's SP represents attractive value at this time, to many others, it represents a chasm of lost value. There was a time when NAB insiders thought that the CBA's SP would never, ever be superior to that of the NAB, yet today the CBA price sits at virtually 3x the value of that of the NAB and for much of the past 10 years has typically been in the 2 - 2.5x range (but rarely at, near or above 3x, until, now).   A radical reset is required at the NAB because the culture is (and remains) infested with self indulgent greed. Perhaps however the next executive REM plan can include gift cards to redeem on TVSN!!
