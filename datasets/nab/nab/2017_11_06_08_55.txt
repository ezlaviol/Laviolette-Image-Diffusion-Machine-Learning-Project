2017-11-06T08:55:00+11:00 : (Adds outlook, CEO quote) 	Nov 6 (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp (WBC) reported a 3 percent rise in annual cash profit on Monday, helped by its consumer and business lending arms and reduced costs on impaired assets, but missed forecasts. 	Australia's No. 2 lender reported a cash profit of A$8.06 billion ($6.17 billion) for the year ended Sept. 30, up from A$7.82 billion a year ago.  	That missed the 4 percent increase in cash profit expected by seven analysts polled by Reuters. 	Cash profit, a measure that excludes one-offs and non-cash accounting items, is closely watched by investors.		On a statutory basis, net profit rose 7 percent to A$7.99 billion.  	Westpac's outlook for the Australian housing market remained positive although it expected "price growth to moderate through 2018", Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer said in a statement.  	The bank added that its net interest margin, a barometer of profitability, was down 4 basis points to 2.06 percent hurt by strong lending competition.  	In March, Westpac and other major banks raised mortgage rates, a move seen as favourable for regulators desperate to cool runaway real estate prices and also good for bank margins.  	Impairment charges fell by 24 percent or A$271 million to A$853 million. 	Westpac's common equity Tier-1 capital ratio at September end rose to 10.6 pct from 9.5 percent a year earlier, above the Australian Prudential Regulation Authorityâ€™s (APRA) target of at least 10.5 percent.  	Westpac announced a final dividend of A$0.94 per share, same as last year. 	($1 = 1.3062 Australian dollars)
