2019-05-02T21:01:00+10:00 : Not sure what you count as 'long' but I with a loss of 16% i would say you are saying 2-3 years given your loss of 16% which i fall into this category however I have been averaging down all this time still in red after today but if 83c for both dividends i am yielding nearly 6.3%.  With about 2% down on capital the ~4% total return isn't great but it sure beat leaving the cash sitting in the bank and better than other shares.I am looking forward to the dividend but I am in accumulation and will keep on accumulating it would hurt alot more if you were in pension phase and was your only holding then year you just received a massive paycut for the next 6 months (maybe more).
