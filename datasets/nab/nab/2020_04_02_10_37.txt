2020-04-02T10:37:00+11:00 : As I have said before I thought that at least the next Div would be severely cut or suspended and I think that is generally accepted in the market. (That's why you need to shut out the noise on HC about Div yields etc in the short term)
The Banks will need time to let full business impact and state of the economy become transparent and preserving capital will be name of the game. 
I would prefer this to happen and don't believe it should impact severely on bank value in the short term, although markets always tend to overshoot the actual news.
Does make for some reasonably easy trading though...............
