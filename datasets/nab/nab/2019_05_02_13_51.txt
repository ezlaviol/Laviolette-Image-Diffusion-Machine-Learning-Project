2019-05-02T13:51:00+10:00 : I'm sorry,... for those who BUY TODAY - it's 6.4%. But we have been long-term holders, loyal holders............ hence,.....1) Our yield is ONLY 5+%, mine is ONLY 5.38% IF the dps for full year goes a bit lower to ONLY 80c ! My spreadsheet is quite accurate. Not taking into consideration franking credits anymore.2) Secondly, I'm now behind (in the red) by 16%.
