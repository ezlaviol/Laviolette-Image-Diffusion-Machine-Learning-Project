2020-05-01T09:03:00+10:00 : Stock to instos today i believe
they are already up well over $2 a share before retailers even get a sniff of their offer of spp shares
I wonder how many instos will lock in a quick profit today
If i was them I would - sell for a quid push the price down then go again

This is why the market is so fair on retail holders
