2020-05-07T16:54:00+10:00 : Inexperienced here, but i am wondering, falling short of there being a massive world-wide recession (instead of just a moderate one) is there any real likelihood that the SP would not be $20 plus in the next 12 months? -Australia's response to COVID has been world leading and assuming no second wave the worst seems to be behind us-Unlike similar hit to SP in 2009 this current uncertainty is fueled by a pandemic and not a systemic financial crisis and housing/ mortgage bubble.There are a tremendous array of other issues facing the global and domestic economies I understand, but i fail to see any real reason to figure that bank stocks SP should be this depressed, as it is basically halved since COVID.
