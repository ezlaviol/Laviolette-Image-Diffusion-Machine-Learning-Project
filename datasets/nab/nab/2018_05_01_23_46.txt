2018-05-01T23:46:00+10:00 : The Big 4 firms, formerly the Big 6 or Big 8; KPMG, PWC, EY and Deloitte IMHO have a lot to answer for as it is they who have consumed a lot of bank costs and shoulder value of late and for little gain. 

All of this consultancy resource seems to be worthless, the banks get in heaps of trouble.

In the States, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehmanâ€™s, Countrywide, AIG, Bear Sterns, it was the same and now the Fed does not allow these consultancies to do much of the work the companies should in truth be doing themselves. 

It has been much better for bank profits and bank regulation/ thrift supervision. 

Even in Canada, OSFI has stopped the consultancies charging over a certain level, RBC, TD, Bank Of Nova Scotia look a lot better as a result. In London England, as well.

AMP used all this consultancy resource and now they are in a fine mess, from Clayton Utz to the Big 4 Public Practice firms, all of these consultancies seem pretty worthless.

If Comyn, Hartzer, Elliott and Thorburn want to reduce cost the spend on these consultancies needs to be torn up and resources with skin in the outcome need engagement IMHO.
