2020-03-31T08:47:00+11:00 : There wonâ€™t because there has only been massive losses for FoxTel preceding the crisis. unless the banks have guarantees from News Corp and Telstra not FoxTel which has been losing them massive amounts of money for many years.this is a high risk way of the banks having a bad debt for the line of credit.Sports like AFL, Super League and Rugby need to go back to being amateur sports, effectively second jobs, like they all were in the 1970s and 1980s, where the players had other jobs mid-week and had a second job on weekends.that is also better for society. ANZ and NAB also need to consider lines of credit to domestic violence charities, support for anti-violence campaigns and drugs narcotics funding if they also want to fund AFL and the other sports given their records of Court cases, domestic violence trials, peptides, domestic violence caused by players having too much money and not enough things to do.ANZ and NAB should be helping out landlords and tenants and property portfolios being maintained not loss making overpaid football codes that were better in their semi-professional/ amateur days IMHO and pre crisis caused massive losses for News Corp and Telstra sholders.
