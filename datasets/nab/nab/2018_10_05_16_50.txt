The S&P/ASX 200 index  (xjo)  closed 0.2 percent higher at 6,185.5. The benchmark is off  0.4 percent for the week, despite gaining over the last two sessions, including a 0.5 percent rise on Thursday.

"Given the risks involved, the share prices have fallen to levels where in relation, the dividend yields are quite enticing to investors for banks," said McCarthy, referring to the risks posed by the Royal Commission outcomes. 	"Banks have dividend yields of 8-10 percent currently and interest rates close to 2 pct, some investors will see that as attractive." 	Elsewhere, Wesfarmers  (WES)  received court approval for a shareholder vote on the spin-off of its supermarket chain, Coles. The conglomerates shares, which were on a trading halt prior to the announcement, closed marginally higher.  	Material stocks  .AXMM , which have lacked some direction this week due to markets being closed in resource-hungry China, inched 0.1 percent higher.

Concerns that the newly-elected government could close down Lynas' plant sent shares skidding 27 percent last month. 	In the energy space, Beach Energy  (BPT)  closed down 3.7 percent, its lowest in over a week as the firm cut its fiscal year 2019 production and core earnings guidance.
