2020-05-22T09:06:00+10:00 : I originally only applied for a portion of the SPP but have since decided I should have gone for more, so today I have topped up  using BPAY. It will be interesting to see if the  payment is accepted on the final day of the SPP and making 2 payments using the same BPAY code. Worst case scenario I get my money back.
