2016-06-28T08:32:00+10:00 : Without being accused of grand-standing or fear-mongering, I'm seeing a potential trigger for a GFC2 here.

It's still too early to say with much confidence, but the way the banks were punished last night... It's highly likely that a bunch of ASX holders were adopting a "wait and see" attitude yesterday and today might see a rush for the doors especially on the banks which are (mostly) already near 12 month low prices.

Be careful.
