2020-04-08T09:47:00+10:00 : SP is largely driven by instos and I think SP is where it is because they have already fully expected significant cuts to Divs.
Of course as it becomes more widely accepted a bit more fear might enter the market and we will see further sell offs at various times (and that fear will be used by some)
As long as the market is confident any cuts or suspension are short term and bad debts don't get out of control there will still be a sound case for buying. (of course what is a good price is the question)
