2020-07-28T12:20:00+10:00 : Freeguy 7, it was interesting how yesterday 'The Australian' published a small article that brought into focus how the 'auction capital' of Australia, Melbourne, is experiencing not just lower auction numbers compared with the same week a year ago, as well as price drops but also listed sellers by auction getting 'nervous' on the day when the auction ought be on and suddenly withdrawing the property from public gaze.I have a holding in NAB but am not very confident that the share price will increase above $18.While we all recognise past history tells us that coronavirus will eventually be less of a problem, many people (unfortunately) have suffered more than your income drop of 35 per cent (which is serious enough!) and hence there will be inevitable pressure on mortgages given gearing ratios.NAB is better run today than has been the case for a while and it's not, nor ought we expect it to be, an altruist.Given high levels of Federal and especially State government debt - we can't 'print money' like those irrational Modern Monetary Theorists claim - there's a fair bit of economic pain still to come, heightened by numerous companies that should really have shut up shop but which JobKeeper appears to be keeping alive.
