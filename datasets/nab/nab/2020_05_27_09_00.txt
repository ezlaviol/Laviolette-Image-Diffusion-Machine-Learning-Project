Likely much lower than 1/3rd for many applicants with smaller holdings. There's just too little shares on offer, and too many NAB shareholders eligible. More than half a million NAB shareholders, and only $500m shares on offer. That's only $1k worth for each applicant. Even if only a third of holders take up the offer and NAB doubles the shares on offer, it's still just $6k worth. No way everyone's getting what they applied for.
