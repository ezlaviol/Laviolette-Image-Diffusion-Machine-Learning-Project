2016-06-11T23:51:00+10:00 : I got out of the diary when it started heading south from 1.05. What a mistake that was . I was watching it hit 1.18 on Friday. Ahh well, I didn't like the way it was trading so I left. And the diary does pay a dividend  IIRC and not a bad one. Of course that might change with recent shenanigans but after Friday's sell off at close. I wish I bought GXY 3 weeks ago when you were buying PLS. Been watching it since 20c but I only bought on Friday! Happy to hold that one, the company looks solid and is actually mining and making sales and that makes me a happy holder. But only 50k shares, not even 30k invested so not losing any sleep over that. So that's now my only non div stock. PLS just looks like it's getting slowly sold down by early investors taking profits to me. You can see the sentiment of the PLS threads turning. That said it might be 90c next week! Always get tempted to throw a handful at the flavour of the month too. Pump and Dumps are great if you get in early! All good fun until someone's deep in the red!  Come on Tuesday!
