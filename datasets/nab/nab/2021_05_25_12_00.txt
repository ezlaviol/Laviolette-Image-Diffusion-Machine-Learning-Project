2021-05-25T12:00:00+10:00 : you missed my point. Chinese banks funds these all day long. We bend over to climate hysteria yet Australia is around 1.3% of global emissions... China’s increase in emissions this year alone is more than Australia’s total contribution to the world. We ignore China and India’s contribution or even the population increases causing further problems.We merely stop using coal here, industry is leaving, only to set up in China... told emissions don’t go down, merely transferring from 1 country to another. Stupidity.
