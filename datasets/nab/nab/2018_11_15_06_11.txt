2018-11-15T06:11:00+11:00 : Last time NAB's sp went lower than 23.93 was in Jan 2013.....since then it hit a high of 37.64 during April 2015.  Dividend paid during 2013 financial year was 1.90 and 2015 was 1.99.

If one bought NAB at yesterday's closing price and they continue to pay an annual dividend of 1.99, the yield will be > 8% without any franking.....not many ASX companies with a current $65B Mkt cap does this consistently with annual cash earnings of  approx. $6B since 2013.
