If you look at a 30 year chart of any of the big 4 banks, they never go sideways for long. It is a whole series of peaks and troughs. IMHO once the market has settled down the banks will creep up in SP, because the downwards movement over the last 4 years has been overdone.

I personally don't care as I bought when the SP was above 11.5% FF basis. All NAB has to do is maintain around the current dividend in the outlook and the SP is likely to start reacting upwards.
After a couple of years with property just going sideways, investors will be looking for higher rates of return (assuming IR stay around the same low levels), the 11%+ FF dividend will gradually fall as people look for 'value' in shares. Only when the FF dividend lowers to 6-8% would I start to get worried that the SP was too high.
It is a cycle that has happened for decades, I'm certainly not prepared to bet that this time is different.
