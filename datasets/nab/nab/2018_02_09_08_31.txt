2018-02-09T08:31:00+11:00 : Just looked at NAB and All Ords over the last 1,3, 5 and 10 years:

NAB share price 1yr -6%, 3yr -19%, 5yr +5%, 10yr 0%
All Ords 1yr +5%, 3yr +2%, 5yr +18%, 10yr +6%
DJIA 1yr +24%, 3yr +41%, 5yr +78%, 10yr +105%

Please note % are approximates.

My point is the DJIA is going througuh acorrection and rightly so....but why are we following suit?  Our market and NAB's share price has barely moved..shame on you Aussie market and the sheep that follow OS trends...
