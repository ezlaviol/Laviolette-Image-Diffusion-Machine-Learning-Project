2016-07-29T17:02:00+10:00 : I know. Pretty good for a Friday!
Don't forget one that was 0; it's done nothing for months.  It's driving me nuts . I might as well put my money somewhere else; waiting for FYR 9th august. I think it could make or break it. 

CBA in the red was a bit of a surprise given the other banks but that's the way it goes. Slight green for BOQ. Good on us .

Have to wait till Monday now .

Didn't spend any money today either!
