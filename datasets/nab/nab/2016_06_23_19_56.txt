It will however surely be a spectacular rout if there's a leave vote. I won't buy in until 10% comes off the banks... well by five percent I'll be getting a very itchy trigger finger.

So we're back to what ever we were obsessing about two weeks ago. Was that China Nanood? I think you're right, a bit of China bashing. And hedge funds planting stories about the imminent collapse of house prices.

And for the bulls, our dollar is creeping up and inflation data coming out next month may point the way to another rate cut.

I just can't see any impetus - short of a nasty surprise tomorrow - to launch out of the trading range we've been stuck in this year. Unless that's just wishful thinking... mmmmm.... trading range.....
