2020-03-25T19:00:00+11:00 : It is actually not that bad for me personally. I have been soaking up NAB shares ever since they hit $20 and the last stash at $13.90 so averaging down all the time. In normal times this is a $28 share. In 12 months time it will be back there so buying it cheap is a 12 month plan no this week or next week. It goes down to $13 again, it just means I average down more.

could be. All cheer and champagne today.What happens next week when there is no more stimulus announcements?Most people will lose a lot of income in the coming days.Stimulus announced so far has been beautiful, it should cushion the landing nicely.
