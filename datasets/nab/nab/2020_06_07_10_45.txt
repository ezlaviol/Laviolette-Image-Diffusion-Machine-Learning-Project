2020-06-07T10:45:00+10:00 : NABâ€™s SP appears too lowball to be a reflection of FV, more pessimistic sentiment has sent it below $20, if the recovery takes hold and pent up demand resumes the positive economic trajectory, NAB should retrace to bullish resistance levels of $30 and beyond IMHO.It has little exposure to Queensland which remains a basket case until November. NSW and Victoria should recover first IMHO but pls DYODD.
