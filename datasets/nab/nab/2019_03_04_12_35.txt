2019-03-04T12:35:00+11:00 : Why I would buy NAB and 2 other ASX dividend shares this week

National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB)

Whilst there are concerns that NAB will have to cut its dividend in order to achieve the CET1 target ratio by 2020, I remain optimistic that its overweight exposure to a strong performing business lending market has put it in a position to maintain it. If worst comes to worst and the NAB board is forced to cut it, I don’t believe it will be a severe cut and would still expect a yield in or around the 7% level instead of the 7.9% yield today. Overall, I think this makes it worth picking up its shares if you don’t already have meaningful exposure to the banks.
