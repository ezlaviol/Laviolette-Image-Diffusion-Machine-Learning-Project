2020-03-31T12:32:00+11:00 : Through FoxTel, AFL is a massive multi-million dollar loss making industry (the NWS TLS accounts support this). Why a bank would extend a line of credit to such a disastrous loss-making industry propped up by the failed FoxTel is beyond me? Telstra were trying to get out of it. News Corp were keeping them in it for the sake of a capital redemption IMHO. Now two banks have made the loss making worse. FoxTel should be pulled and News Corp and Telstra need to move on provided they have not guaranteed it to the two banks concerned which it looks like they have not.The LNP Victoria wanted to knock down the old Docklands Stadium. Robert Doyle as Lord Mayor was wanting to get it knocked down, NAB's Head Office would have been surrounded by a construction site. Alas, due to an incident in the Yarra Valley, Robert Doyle was hospitalised and the ill-fated Docklands Stadium got a reprieve. The community wanted it knocked down and Robert Doyle knew that.AFL has never made money. Should return to being the VFL, SANFL, WAFL, SFL and TAFL. ANZ and NAB are now extending a line of credit to an enormous loss making business. ANZ already has form in sponsoring the ill-fated Virgin Australia. NAB had the misfortunate of sponsoring a game that was sending FoxTel broke, and NewsCorp and Telstra having to put bad money after bad.Now NAB will be putting bad money after bad when it needs to be getting its house in order from all its Court cases and compliance issues. It already has reduced all its staff. Propping up the failed AFL is a great idea if it wants to extend its bad debt provision IMHO. Or wants to support News Corp and/ or Telstra get out of their loss making FoxTel mess.
