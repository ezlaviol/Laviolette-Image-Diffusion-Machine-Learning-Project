1. 98% will get pro rata entitlement.
2. Pro rata based on holding on Record Date 24/4/20.
3. Those with larger holdings (2%) will get less than pro rata due to $30K cap, i.e. SH with 5,000 shares will only get $30k worth = 2068 shares.
4. SH with 2068 or more shares will get maximum of 2068 shares, pro rata for $30k worth.
5. SH with less than 2068 shares will get the same number as they held at Record Date, e.g. If held 1,000 shares and applied for maximum $30k, they will receive 1,000.
6. SH with 1,000 shares who applied for less than maximum $30k will be scaled back proportionately, e.g. 1,00o shares and applies for $20k worth will receive (20000/30000 x 1,000) = 667 shares.
7. I have 1,290 shares and have applied for $30K worth. I expect I will get my full pro rata entitlement of 1,290 shares at a cost of $18,705 which coincidentally is about the average application amount $188,500.

That's how I'd do it anyway.
