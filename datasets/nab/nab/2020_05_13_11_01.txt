My guess is that NAB SP is headed towards 14.51 (not exact), ie. that there's incentive to sell while price is above 14.51. There's a bit of security in the offer, because a spell for the SP below 14.51 gets a small discount on the lower price. NAB moving early on a share offer could well put it in a better place than others, so my approach is to apply for shares and then just hold onto my hat for the ride.
