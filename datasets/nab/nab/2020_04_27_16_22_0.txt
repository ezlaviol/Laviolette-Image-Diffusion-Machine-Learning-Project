I used those large bank dividends in 2015 and 2016 to buy stocks like BHP when battered. As I’m doing now I’ve used large dividends elsewhere to buy banks in this crisis (doing poorly right now though!!!) but also BHP, AMC, WPL, TAH, CWN, SGR, SCG etc which I’m up on all and up to 35% on some bought in that horrid week in May. Win some lose some. Banks I’ve lost so far. However holdings since the 1990s and CBA IPO have done amazingly well.
