in  2001  (  that's 17  years ago ),   NAB was also at $ 29
17  years ago !!!
so "blue chip stocks" always recover, right  ?
not to mention the opportunity cost of not being in stocks that have risen
greatly over the past 16 years.
quality stocks do recover but NAB has certainly NOT been a quality stock for
many years.	
"very well managed" ?	 baloney !
