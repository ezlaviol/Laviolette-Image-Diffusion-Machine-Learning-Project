2019-02-08T10:07:00+11:00 : Something to note from the qly and pillar report

Well - in the nab qly - the provisions for impairment were up 20% on pcp, but good compared to the previous two quarters, but in the pillar report 90 day past dues not impaired rocketed by about 30% on pcp, and are up significantly against previous quarters as well. The canary is looking sick at NAB. CBA had no such problems.
