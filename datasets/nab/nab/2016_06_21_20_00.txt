2016-06-21T20:00:00+10:00 : At the risk of being modded for a political discussion on NAB, I think the possibility of a Labor win is much better than the odds suggest. So to bring this back to the banks, all things being equal (I.e the SP isn't a screaming buy), I wouldn't like to be holding bank stocks over the election. I think there *is* uncertainty and the market *hasn't* priced it in. There you go, thanks guys for helping me come to that epiphany after all my BS this afternoon. 

In fact, it's the reason I got out today because I didn't want to be holding over Brexit because I reckon there is more uncertainty than is now priced in.

Still, come election eve or Brexit eve, if the polls and odds are the same as tonight and NAB s $25.00, it's still a screaming buy I reckon.
