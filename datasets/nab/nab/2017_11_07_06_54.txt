2017-11-07T06:54:00+11:00 : Technology will see a lot more than 6,000 banking jobs go. I work in finance, the writing is on the wall, many many low end jobs will all be automated by tech. This is only the beginning.

I don't invest in what ifs. As much as I'd love iron ore to remain at around $70-$80, i sinserely doubt it will. Hence the price dropped below $60. Also china represents 75% or so of the iron ore trade mate. Selling 1 shipment to Germany isn't going to do anything, the demand is all in China. Anyway stick to this stuff in the FMG thread. The stock has done well, but it now has structural issues.
