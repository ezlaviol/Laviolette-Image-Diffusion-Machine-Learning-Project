2020-06-09T21:53:00+10:00 : Job keeper is $1500 per fortnight and has a termination date in September. I still go to work and could lose my job just in time for Christmas. Thing is, at least I get more than $1500 a fortnight. Jobkeeper keeps people alive - it won't make anyone rich. There is also no guartantee that they will have a job when jobkeeper ends. I doubt your mate has changed his lifestyle just because he can afford takeaways. A lot of people are doing that if they are stuck at home.

POne gentleman who works for a security company( casual ),  Last two months he is at home (I know him personally, lives next door)... Few days back I asked him what happened has he lost the job ? He said he is on Jobkeeper now which is almost 30% higher than what he was earning earlier. (As per my understanding his employer advised him to go on Job Keeper as it helps them save money )..His life style has changed now. Regular Home Delivery, Food Delivered while I still go to work each day and does not if I will even have a job of the June...
