You keep making these statements but don't provide any evidence to support. The current cr is brought on by regulatory authorities in Aus and the UK not to "prop up" a failing business.
Please show where and when nab keeps "getting propped up through cash injections"
I presume you do realise that the Aussie big 4 were some of the few large banks worldwide that didn't need propping up during the GFC (and don't bother citing the "bank G'tee") .  I've held shares in NAB since the mid '80's and had a quick look through share history and you are talking absolute nonsense.
Of course I don't believe NAB has performed as well as it could have on occasions however as a wealth builder its done just fine.
Happy for you to make money from shorting just don't start stating rubbish as facts.
