2018-12-05T07:17:00+11:00 : This us true IMO but today's GDP report will set theme for December. Impact of housing market on GDP, construction, consumer spending, business investment and profits, unemployment etc. Most banks and analysts have softened their expectations already...3.3-3.5% lift in GDP will be a great result. Increase in consumer spending will probably be the key as it is an indicator of consumer sentiment. Time will tell....
