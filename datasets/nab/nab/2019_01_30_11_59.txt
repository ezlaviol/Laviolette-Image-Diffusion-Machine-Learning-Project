2019-01-30T11:59:00+11:00 : hi paydirt, I bought that same amount last year, a brutal time to be in nab, despite the two divs I'm well and truly under water, I started buying in April when nab was trading about 1.50 above anz, it's now reversed, I bought the transformation story, fintech etc, I'm still fairly confident long term, but it's amazing to me that it's yielding over 8%ff, clearly the market doesn't believe the div, or a massive mis-pricing is occurring
