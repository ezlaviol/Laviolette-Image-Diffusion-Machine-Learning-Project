'We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA (effectively removed all genetic material of the virus) by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,' Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute's Dr Kylie Wagstaff said on Friday.

Our government should get behind this and fast track it so the drug can be quickly distributed throughout the world and put an end to this problem quickly.
