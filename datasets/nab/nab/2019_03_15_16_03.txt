NAB shares are at a very low premium at the moment and while I don't see a meteoric rise happening I do believe they will appreciate in value over the next few years.Maybe once you have all your thoughts together, you may consider it the same way and have another go at them

I sold my NAB holdings yesterday. In hindsight I shouldn’t have. I made decent profit which is redeeming but regardless, run free NAB holders. I bought because I believed. I sold because I made an emotional  decision at the time.Dont be like me.Hold fast
