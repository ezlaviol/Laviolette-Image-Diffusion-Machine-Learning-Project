2016-06-30T23:36:00+10:00 : Not looking too bad actually, at the moment. I am even green on my crappy, hurried (due to lack of time) parcel I picked up last Friday (@24.75). Volatility is way up there and I really am not sure what is going to happen. Having said that, banks traditionally drift up from 1st of July onwards and despite the gloom and doom prophets (sometimes lurking  on this thread) I have not seen any negative reports from any of the big 4 (ANZ foray into Asia excepted); in fact they have generally reported slightly increased profits. Now with RBA rates looking to drop soon, or at least not increasing for the foreseeable future, thanks to Brexit, I think there is a lot of potential in the banks. Agree that BEN and BOQ should have a good little rise from here. So, as currently FOMO > FOLM I think I will stay on board the banks roller coaster for now.
I think $30 will be pushing it, but it hit $29 just before ex div earlier this year, so with an interest rate cut or two, you never know. Here's hoping as I still have a parcel over $27 that needs to be covered.
In the meantime my Li friend looks like it might be on the verge of something big, so I might have a lot more $ soon to spend on NAB ......., or it could all go down the drain. At least it is exciting.
