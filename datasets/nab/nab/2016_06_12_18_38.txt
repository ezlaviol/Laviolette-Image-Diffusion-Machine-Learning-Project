Nab might get close to 24. I'll be buying a decent slice of if reaches 25. ANZ maybe 23. I pay no attention to the "world worries" spouted in the 24hr media cycle. Honestly, last week gold was going to $1100 and the stocks were booming. This week gold is heading to 1300 and the world is collapsing. All I need is the banks to be cheap. Dirt cheap. Cba $70 for you
