2020-07-20T16:24:00+10:00 : It will be interesting to see the market's (and banks' share prices) reaction to the Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's 23 July announcement that has been flagged as sector-specific extension for JobKeeper, and a rise (though to less than $1100 a fortnight) in JobSeeker (the former Newstart dole benefit).On the one hand the government deficit is ballooning and sooner or later we all have to face reality, but on the other, there just aren't the immediate jobs to soak up all the newly unemployed or underemployed, including those in companies that really ought have finished operation by now.  JobKeeper govt payments is the only thing keeping some of these companies 'alive.'
