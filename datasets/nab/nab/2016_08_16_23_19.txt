Firstly, what you have access to is what others want you to see (PLS), and sometimes you can know more about something than Mrs. Market which means you misjudge her reaction to the stock as you see something the market does not see  (CAJ). Along those lines I am very curious to see how Mrs. Market reacts to BHP tomorrow ...... Besides all the information you could ever possibly need is right here on HC , isn't it.
CBA tomorrow matters little to me, but I am interested to see what happens. I will simply hold as it did not rally enough pre ex div. I wonder if the RBA minutes implying no more cuts for the rest of the year cooled the banks off. Yes looking forward to the dividend.
Hoping nab can squeeze 46 cents up or so, but I seriously doubt it; noticed OS futures, FTSE, DAX, our futures are down and gold is up. 
Any thoughts on the next NAB dividend .
