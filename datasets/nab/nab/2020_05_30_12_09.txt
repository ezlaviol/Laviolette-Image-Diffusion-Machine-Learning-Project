2020-05-30T12:09:00+10:00 : You just need to be patient.Traders will play with stock between $15 and $19, grabbing a % or 2 with high volumes moving day by day.Not what I am interested in.Buying in at $14 will see that as bottom in my view, valuation now back nearing book value. I will ride the recovery, with ups and downs, and WILL see NAB back to $20+ , by end July if not 30 June, in my viewThe value of going long on banks, again my view, DYOR, is that it is more likely banks will not see recession like losses on their books and quite the opposite profits are likely to be greater that pessimistic ally thought. And likely too that ANZ and Westpac may review their books in August and payout say a small dividend of 30 cents like NAB. But yes expect CBA to trim their dividend to $1.50 or so in August tooRemember, our Banks paying out dividends will help economic recovery, is spending, and this then leads also to Banking profitability too
