[TOKYO] Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Company has agreed to buy 80 per cent of National Australia Bank's life insurance unit for about 200 billion yen (US$1.65 billion), a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Earlier in the day, NAB, Australia's No1 lender by assets, placed its shares on a trading halt ahead of an announcement of a "material transaction".
An announcement on the sale of NAB's insurance unit is expected on Wednesday when the lender announces full-year earnings, the source, who could not be identified, added.
