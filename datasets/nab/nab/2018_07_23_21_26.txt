2018-07-23T21:26:00+10:00 : My bank (this one!) wants me to talk to myself more about what I really want. It's not about the money we are told.

I'm going to tell them that I've talked to myself and we've decided that we're going to close all of our accounts. I hope they understand that it's not about the $ at all, it's probably more about trust and honesty.

thanks for reading / rant over.
