I think the interest rate on them at $71.50 is about 5.2% with no tax credits. So most of the new Hybrids are around 4.7%(only guessing) but with a tax credit of 30% putting they with a yeild over 6%. So NABHA could still fall a few more $ yet, as they are still over priced to the other Hybrids.

What happened with the Teir 1 capital requirement in about 2010 was they changed the rules so NABHA will not count toward Tier 1 capital of the banks, but rather than do it all in one hit, these type of Hybrits would lose 10% a year 2010 till 2020. So in the year 2020 NABHA will not count at all for Teir one capital. At the moment they count at 50% next year 40%.

They reason they were more expensive is because a lot of people thought the bank would redeem them(including me). But when they didn't do in the last Hybrid issue it looks like it is years away if at all.
