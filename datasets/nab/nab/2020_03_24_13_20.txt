2020-03-24T13:20:00+11:00 : Citi & UBS are Hedge Funds (they bet big on downward side), when hey say buy means Sell and Run Away. That is how History has proven so far...Market always comes in three phase. First one smart one, phase two forced selling (We are now in second phase), thrid phase when Reality Hit...Phase 3 is 20% below phase two. ..Remember History Repeats itself.  We will now enter third phase...(Have a look at DOW Jones. Two phase completed. Third Phase of selling will starts now i.e. gradual slide downward. One day up and two days down)......
