Depending on the stupid media 24hr cycle the next day could be optimistic or pessimistic. That's why I encourage you to take profits when they present themselves to you. You will never come on to HC and complain that you took a profit. You and I will probably never tip the high or the low, but if you walk away with a profit it's hard to complain.
