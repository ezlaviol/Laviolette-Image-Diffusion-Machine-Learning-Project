2020-05-31T09:22:00+10:00 : You realise that 30 year old sought no medical treatment and had underlying health issues... Old and immunocompromised people remain at risk. ICU capacity in NSW alone has doubled. Yes some risk remains, but people need to get on with their lives. Each localised outbreak will be locked down to prevent continued infection, but there will be no second society wide lockdown. That means banks will continue to be utilised as they were, with impacts off those localised outbreaks. So I doubt the sp drops much more.
