2015-11-13T13:00:00+11:00 : 5k profit from 5k initial outlay it's a risk but most times it pays off and if you only put in a small amount it doesn't keep you up at night although sometimes I do go in big. The trick is get in before the masses or if a stock is clearly showing upward momentum. How often do you find these? Maybe one every month or two I tend to be selective and do miss some or get some wrong but that's why stop losses are important.
