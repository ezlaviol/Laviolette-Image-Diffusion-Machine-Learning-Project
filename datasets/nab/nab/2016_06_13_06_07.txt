2016-06-13T06:07:00+10:00 : 1k gets me started. That's a small bite . BOQ, hmm not so small with that one. That was more of a gamble looking for an off the $11 bounce. Not sure whether to add any more to BOQ or not. More interested in BEN as its getting shorted so I'd like 5k of them too and save the rest for NAB first then ANZ only if it gets really cheap. 250's and 500's tops now unless we get one of those slaughter days and something wonderful happens. Guns loaded 

Wife says cake is bad so now I feel bad eating cake = punishment
