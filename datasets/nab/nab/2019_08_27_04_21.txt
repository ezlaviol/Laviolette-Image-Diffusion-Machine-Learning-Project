To get electricity connected outside of rural areas does attract a charge for the council to get that work undertaken if it is not considered part of the normal grid. It's not corruption and pretty normal "user pay" practice.That won't make Giz any happier paying for it of course. $8k is quite a hit.

i don't understand, is that city or country, because the monthly service and utility fee everyone pays is supposed to cover all infrastructure. I know some phone company offered to connect Foxtel etc to an apartment building and the dumb body corporate manager advised Tennants to pay it. What corruption goes on around us. Of course a couple of  landlords refused so it was installed free, as is supposed to be!
