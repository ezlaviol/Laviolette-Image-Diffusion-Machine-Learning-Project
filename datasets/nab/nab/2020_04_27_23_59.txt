So you can’t blame them for the economic ills when they come and then blame them when they leave or get deported?NAB’s results have been affected by immigrants in all its history, do not know why you blame the immigrants and their lack of ability getting well paid jobs and being low wage scum, then blame them for the NAB result when they rack off.we need to be consistent hereIMHO and can’t have it both ways. Don’t have any immigrants to Australia at all if they lead to a poor banking system.McEwan and McKeon managed the poor RBS and AMP results when the immigration system was better than today in England and Australia so I would say it was them, as a better more explanatory factor?
