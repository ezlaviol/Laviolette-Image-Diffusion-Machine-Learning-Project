2019-09-28T15:37:00+10:00 : The RBA spins this line about the growth rate being positive when Dr Philip Lowe, the RBA Governor, is making claims that do not appear on a GDP per basis to be credible. I think the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis May be right, Australia has had three recessions in 28 years and on a GDP per capital basis is doing very badly, only population growth is creating GDP growth. The economy is mainly contracting.Interest rates are far too high in Australia and should perhaps be negative otherwise unemployment will increase, defaults will get higher and NAB will struggle with its continuing issues of governance, risk and compliance.
