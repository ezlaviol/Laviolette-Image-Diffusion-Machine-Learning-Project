An even so, NABs loans consist ofÂ a higher commercial loan basis opposed to residential or investment loans. So as long as the economy is ticking a long which Aus is atm we may see a slight drop but $2 drop would to me be we are headed for a 2019 Recession. As Tench pointed out, there is a lot of stuff going on atm. US pulling out of Syria, Russia and China fighting for power, Brexit, Clowns we have in Parliament potentially upsetting housing market. If Bill the dill gets in and grandfathers negative gearing. One thing people are missing with negative gearing removal is yes it stops investors, but you also then have a massive drop in potential buyers if your looking to sell your place. How much do investors make up in a market 20%/40%? Without them it would be an across the board cull on property prices. So all people that have been contributing to the tax system for years or decades of work have to suddenly also suffer capital losses on property to assist people getting into the market. I cant imagine this would be good for any of the big banks. Huge downgrades to assets previously overstated in value?
