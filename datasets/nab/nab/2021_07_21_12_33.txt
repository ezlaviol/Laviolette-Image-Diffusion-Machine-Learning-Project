I’m sick of hearing colleagues selling properties being asked to extend finance condition dates as NAB can’t perform in the required timeframes. I’d expect share buybacks or special dividends. The Board at NAB need to take a good, long, hard look at themselves and remember who actually owns the enterprise.
