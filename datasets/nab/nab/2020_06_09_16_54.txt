2020-06-09T16:54:00+10:00 : My cheque arrived in the mail on Tuesday 9 June 2020.  I've already been to my local Australia Post Licensed Post Office to bank it using Bank@Post with my NAB credit card. I am in Melbourne, so maybe those interstate may have to wait two or more further business days to receive their cheque if not having the refund paid directly to a bank account.The NAB cheque was drawn on its 330 Collins St, Melbourne branch so I assume Computershare posted all these refunds from Melbourne not elsewhere.  Given that Monday 8 was a public holiday in Victoria (and every other state except Qld and WA), to receive the cheque in two business days from last Thursday was fine.
