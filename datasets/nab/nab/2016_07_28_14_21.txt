2016-07-28T14:21:00+10:00 : ive noticed a bit of talk on this thread regarding boq

I generally tend to stick to the asx20 stocks for my trading

does anyone have an informed opinion of boq regarding the strength of its balance sheet

its genral strengths and weaknesses

possible threats to its share price

ive had a cursory look at it and deciding whether to start accumulating some for the run up to the div

its at 52 week lows and appears to deliver a good dividend, looks pretty compelling to me???

appreciate some constructive thoughts on the strength of this company
