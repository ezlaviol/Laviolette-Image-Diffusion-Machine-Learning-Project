2016-02-03T12:58:00+11:00 : Clydesdale will be dual listed....like BHP, Henderson, etc. One CDI in Clydesdale (CYB on ASX) will be issued for every four NAB shares owned. A CDI is an instrument for a dual-listed international share traded on ASX. They are not time sensitive (my Henderson CDIs are going on 10 years now?). Enjoy.
