Same here. Had put in a low ball bid at 33.26 based on nothing but greed but 33.35 is as far low as it ventured.I am sure you will get more than your fair chance in the DRP pricing period of 7 days commencing 20/5/2014.I imagine brokers will look at the market reaction and upgrade the SP targets now?
