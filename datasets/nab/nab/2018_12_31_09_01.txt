2018-12-31T09:01:00+11:00 : I am a SF retiree. Lucky for me, all those who were in pension phase on Mar 2108 are not going to be affected. So if you take all those retirees out, they may not get as much as they thought and (considering the votes), yes, they probably will try to be the good guys for the the seniors.  I already got hit with the increase in tapering rate from 1.50 to 3.00 (that's a hundred % increase, yes 100%, what other things change by 100%, no thanks to the Greens and SCOMO).
