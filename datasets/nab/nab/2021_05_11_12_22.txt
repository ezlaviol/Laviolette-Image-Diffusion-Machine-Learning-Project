2021-05-11T12:22:00+10:00 : I had never heard of 86 400 (showing my ignorance) but asked some early 20s youths I know, with two responding they had online accounts with it.NAB under the relatively new management is doing well, concentrating on the knitting.  Some comments NAB made on business banking progress yesterday were extremely pleasing.  It's defending its market-leading position very well.  So many in business I know say it's far and away the best bank for companies or sole traders, though there may have been an element of confirmation bias in their comments.Provided 'Mr Market' doesn't perceive that it massively overpaid for 86 400, this is a positive move and will add to U Bank's success over time.
