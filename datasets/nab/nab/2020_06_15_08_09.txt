After the BB there is plenty more to do.  And that doesn't include the camper trailer that will be our home for between one and two years.FYI, modern 4 cylinder twin turbo diesel engines have become fairly bulletproof in recent years, except when you run up the arse of someone or hit a stray animal, then, it is fairly well understood that twin turbo diesels don't do well after.
