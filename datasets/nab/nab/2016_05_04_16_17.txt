Hoping the div remains the same too.
When the RBA cut the cash rate yesterday, NAB were the first to announce they'd pass the cut on to borrowers. I might be reading into it too much but that communicates confidence to me.

Then again ANZ posted a shocker earlier in the week and the SP rose (lol what ?), so what's reality got to do with the market any more? 

Keen to read how it's going as I've been building a position over a number of years now through DRP and careful accumulation (most recent buy at 24.10 in Feb was a good pick up).
