2020-03-19T11:34:00+11:00 : The roaring 1920s might be revisited. For those that survive, they will prosper. Employment will go back up and things will resume as normal and there will still be a need for banking IMHO.In fact, I think places like Sydney (and perhaps Melbourne) where most of NAB is based and people might actually want to live, might prosper the most. Problem for NAB is Victorian Government and for BNZ, the NZ Governments are possibly the worst geopolitically lot of politicians across the galaxy in general. However the Yarra and Dandenongs might eventually from their beauty elicit a better group of politicians or free market or else NAB can just move away from Melbourne and Victoria.A lot better than couped up in an apartment in a big metropolis without anything really good to do or see, the Hudson does not quite look as good as Yarra, Dandenongs, Sydney Harbor and the nearest bush is probably Upstate somewhere amongst the timber sheds compared with the walking tracks in SE Melbourne, Dandenongs and Mornington Peninsula.I would be optimistic for NAB's future, banking future and Australia/ NZ in general.
