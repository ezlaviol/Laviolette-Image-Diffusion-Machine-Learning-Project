The overall yield will be around 6%, but that includes the franking credit, so it will comprise of 4.2% cash and 1.8% franking credit. This is just over half what the ordinary shares are yielding, at the moment of course. 

Trouble I have with these in general is that if the proverbial really hits the fan, they convert and that is just the time when I would not want my exposure to ordinary shares increased. Nevertheless, given the chance of a loss event is very small, a yield of 4% + 3BBSW paid quarterly is not too bad.
