But honestly, the current offer ratio is 2/25....
The Appendix 3B says that there will be a maximum of 193,688,937 issued.
Current shares on issue are 2,614,867,151

This represents a 7% increase in the shares on issue.... not exactly enough to put the stock into downwards selling pressure considering their stellar result for the half year

If they we're doing a 1/1 ratio THAT would make sense to see the stock plummet...
