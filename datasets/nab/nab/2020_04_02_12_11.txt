2020-04-02T12:11:00+11:00 : I don't disagree, I would think this should be a business decision though rather than a government forced one. I mean CBA paid out a dividend earlier this week, they are facing very similar conditions.As for the stimulus, it hasn't even hit yet. Only the announcement has been made, that being said the market is going to remain volatile until either the situation improves markedly or a vaccine is approved for use and being mass manufactured. Those two timeframes might coincide.Long term though this continues to have value at current prices.
