2022-09-04T18:58:00+10:00 : They have all been under-resourced and understaffed for so long, especially NAB and CBA with their money laundering errors, all their Financial Services Royal Commission errors, and all their consumer protection problems but may be they are no worse than other oligopolies throughout financial services, utilities, casinos, grocers, airlines, insurers?With ABC singling out Qantas on its 4 Corners program on Monday night AEST, the Big 4 banks next being called out for under resourcing and understaffing but how about financial services companies beyond just NAB and the Big 4 banks?How about the regulators? Are they not understaffed and under resourced? And did they not let NAb and the Big 4 Banks down in Australia get so understaffed and under resourced?And how about the auditors like the embattled Ernst & Young, did they not call out the banks for understaffing and under resourcing? With this Ernst & Young employee in Sydney having died the way she did, it is a wonder NAB have not done something about Ernst & Young having this audit of NAB?All the understaffing, under resourcing and overwork, is NAB about to be called out for it? letâ€™s see how it all pans out. There is more of a stench to go around a few others IMHO.
