Of the 1m infected how many presented with symptoms? probably most, How many with symptoms are at home? a lot more. How many live in countries where there is little testing? even more.Of the million, how many hospitalised, how many in ICU, what age demographic, underlying health problems, etc, etc.Read the real Italian stats and you may get some sobering news (88% of those dead had at least 2 or 3 other ailments of which they where dying and were senior citizens) Google the Italian PM's Medical advisors statement to fact check. We are not Italy or anywhere else and will not have the same issues, we are younger, healthier and better equiped. Our banks will take a hit due to Government actions beyond their control, but will bear the brunt of criticism, of not doing enough. I dont hold, but am in the wings waiting for what I see is a coming opportunity to jump on board.
