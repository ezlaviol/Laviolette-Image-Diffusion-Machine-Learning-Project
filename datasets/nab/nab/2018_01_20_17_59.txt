2018-01-20T17:59:00+11:00 : Fear can be your own worst enemy, I know! Was heavy in all banks pre GFC, had to sell some but held on and in fact topped up at very low levels. The lesson I have learnt from over 30 years of investing is to not offload blue chip stocks, particularly in the worst of times. If your capital is returning you a healthy dividend, even if you show a paper loss, hold on because quality stocks always recover.

NAB is one such stock, well capitalised, government guaranteed backing, very well managed, and functioning in an economy that has not experienced a recession in 25 years. Remember, the world economy is well recovering from the GFC, bank lending here is well protected from any house price fallback (thanks due to our well regarded prudential safeguards) and the margin that NAB receive are very healthy thanks due to their access to cheap overseas funding. 

In the medium term, I confidently see NAB leading a bank resurgence after the Royal Commission, which will not give major grief to the banks. They will acknowledge their sins, pay fines, and move on.....our banking system is the best in the world. Institutions and super funds will ALWAYS hold significant stakes in them.
