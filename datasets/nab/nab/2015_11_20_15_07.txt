2015-11-20T15:07:00+11:00 : I am really interested to see how the market reacts to the Clydesdale spin off. I'm seeing upside for both NAB and the new entity, but we are all living through these times of the banks getting smashed and recovering and on and on.

I bought on news of the clydesdale spin off, on Thorburns ability to a) make a decision on strategy and b) carry out that strategy on time and as planned, and the cherry on top was dividend. I have caught the last two dividends and intend to hold for the medium term and reassess.

NAB is due to have a run and in my view, the CEO now is making it lean and is doing a good job carrying out the plan. Will his full strategy project NAB to quality from flounderer? That's why I'm here for the ride to find out.

Clydesdales has actually been on the improve for a while, and even though it's ROE may not be at a level NAB expects, it is still turning a reasonable stream. Standing alone, that stream might be seen as acceptable to to the astute investor.
