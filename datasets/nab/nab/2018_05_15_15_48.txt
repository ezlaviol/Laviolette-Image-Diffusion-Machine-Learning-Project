2018-05-15T15:48:00+10:00 : IMO I think that NAB will fall further in the short/medium term. The reason for this is if you read the NAB CEO letter addressing the RC, you will see that NAB are apologising to customers. The issued although being corrected since then, has yet come under scrutiny from the RC. While there is no certainty, again IMO NAB will probably suffer some small fine for misconduct/ repay wrong doings. As such $26 over the next year or so is a possibility. Having said this longer term outlook I think will turn around and return to $30+

Again just an opinion and I don't think dividends will change over the next few years. NAB profit will hopefully increase in the distant future from cash rate rises when the economy picks up, which is only a matter of time.
