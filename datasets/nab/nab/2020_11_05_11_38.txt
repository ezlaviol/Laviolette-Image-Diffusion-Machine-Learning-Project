2020-11-05T11:38:00+11:00 : I agree it's not a great yield, however it looks like we are at the bottom of the rate cutting cycle for now (unless the rba go negative, which I doubt) it's also likely that the banks will benefit from relaxed lending rules, they also hold a lot of capital, and if the economy picks up after a vaccine, they may start to return it and increase the divs since they are paying low percentages from cash earnings, a lot of analysts have raised their target prices, I own three of the majors and will sell if they get to mid 20's again, I'm worried about relaxing the lending rules and the extremely cheap money, it all points to a housing disaster in the next couple of years
