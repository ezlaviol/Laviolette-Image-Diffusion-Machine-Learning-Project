Now the Australian CBA site might be better, Ihave no way of testing but judging by ASB, I would not hold my breath. And the air quality is better here in NYC save for sleet than it is in Sydney especially after Tanya Goldberg’s fireworks in a total fire ban.So for mine, ideas that CBA is ahead on digital is ridiculous, I mean why did they have the AUSTRAC fines then, and that Inquiry that the non-banking experience Chair Livingstone created, and the fines and the data breaches and the AML situation. The evidence points to CBA being the worst of the banks not the best. Even the fines and penalties to date and the Royal Commission bear that out.As for NAB, it did get punished in the Royal Commission but not by as much, the scandal was not down to the digital side as the digital side was not much developed.ANZ and Westpac (despite the latter’s AML flaws and potential fine) appear based on the evidence to have the best. And no scandal, not yet anyways.
