2020-04-28T13:02:00+10:00 : I am happy for you to look at Canadian banks, some who didn't even need to raise capital during the GFC and haven't reduced their dividends in more than 50 years, because they kept even higher amounts of regulatory capital than their Australian peers and based their payout ratios to around 40-50%. They planned for stormy days like this. Even in the US, you need regulatory approval to increase your dividends and banks have been hell-bent on "fortress" balance sheets. In Australia, I'd add that CBA and Macquarie appear very well capitalised. Another link I would direct you to is NAB's capital raising announcement, which in itself is excellent spin for management's inability to plan for severe shocks.
