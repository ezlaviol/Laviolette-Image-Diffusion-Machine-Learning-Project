2016-06-23T09:09:00+10:00 : The remain vote still ahead, although some polling methodology has changed in the uk to try and make the polls reflect the results after polls failed to predict the last uk elections. I guess if you can't predict the future then it's time to start messing with the numbers. Some info available if you look up ft polling methodology on what has changed.
