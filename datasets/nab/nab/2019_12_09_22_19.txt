Another year has passed in lazy town. Our lazy man digs out his NAB portfolio from the bottom drawer and reminisces. Let's see. RC has been and gone. The housing market didn't collapse. Another bank is in the bad books with AUSTRAC. Interest rates keep falling. The on again, off again trade wars continue. Fintechs are the new threat; maybe. Hmmmm. Nothing is really new, so meh. Oh wait, better see what the NAB holding is worth now. He updates his spreadsheet from before and it now looks something like this View attachment 1882351So the initial investment of 10K last time was $25 at the end of 2000 is now worth around 51k, the same as if the SP had increased to $130 per share. Oh well, our lazy man mutters as he shrugs his shoulders in apathy, and pops them back into the bottom drawer. Until next year!

And don’t forget your initial investment of $10K is now yielding you over $3K in tax free dividends! The wonder of long time skin in the game, you won’t go bust investing in major banks in Australia, and because our super industry relies on them for dividends you are guaranteed high yield tax free income.The doomsayers go on about capital gain and losses, and arguablely a narrow range of trading valuation. But I beg to differ, rely on dividend streams and buy into banks during down periods, like now, and reap capital gains too. Have also been heavily invested in banks since 1994, ie bought $10K worth of NAB for about $7 a share, currently hold over $3M in banks shares, in and outside of super, not being smart in saying this but highlighting that you could do a lot worse with your investments and hard earned cash. Go long and hard
