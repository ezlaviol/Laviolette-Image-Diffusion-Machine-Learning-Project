But... What's your thesis on where this is going and what it tells us short-medium term?

I like NAB as a long term yield play, my average buy price is around the $26.50 Mark and I particularly like the DRP option that NAB maintains.

Housing in Sydney/Melbourne has cooled significantly with just about every observer now calling an end to the Sydney boom. Can the Sydney market go backwards and if so what impact does that have on our big 4? Pert prices were -22% in the last 12 months, if that happens in Sydney I wonder what it does to bad loans & big banks?
