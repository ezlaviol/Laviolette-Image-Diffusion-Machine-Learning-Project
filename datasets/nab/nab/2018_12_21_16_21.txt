I topped up on close, and will continue to accumulate as it falls. Sub $20? Bring it on I say. 

Sure, like everyone else, I don't like seeing red on my purchases in the short term, but in the long term I am very confident this will pay off handsomely. >10% pa return in the long term from a company that is in the ASX20 and now, thanks to APRA, RC etc is stronger than ever.
