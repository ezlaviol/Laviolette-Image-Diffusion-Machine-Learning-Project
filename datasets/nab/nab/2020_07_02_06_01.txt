2020-07-02T06:01:00+10:00 : Three words "Panic didn't happen". Dow started positive and only went slightly negative(-0.3%) in late trading. With all the bad news of the spread of the virus around the world NAB seems to be a holding pattern from $18 to $19. Holding up well for the last 6 weeks or so. Probably won't go too much higher until a vaccine is developed. IMO
