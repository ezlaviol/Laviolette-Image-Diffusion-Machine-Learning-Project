Could be what John Neal was to QBE or Ian Narev to CBA. Let me explain. John Neal took huge writedowns on acquisitions made by QBE("big bath" provisions)which he could arguably blame on his predecessor, the hall of famer Frank O Halloran. QBE share price has just gone down-down under him.There were fears when Ian Narev took over from Ralph Norris there would be a similar increase in provisions which he could blame on his predecessor. However he has been steady hands throughout and if anything CBA only posted even stronger results after his ascension.As a general guide, the profitability of banks depends to a very large extent on accounting estimates such as provisions and there is some discretion on what a particular number should be without it necessarily being wrong or right. The positive is that the Thorburn is an insider, being CEO of NZ so he has to take some accountability for past performance.
