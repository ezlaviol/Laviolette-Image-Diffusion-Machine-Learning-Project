2016-05-27T15:15:00+10:00 : Just been studying NAB's chart. It seems to cop a slight hammering for a couple of weeks after going XD and then makes a bit of a run up. The other 3 of the big 4 have all been on the upside during this period.
So I have just stuck my neck out and bought some today for $27.35.
