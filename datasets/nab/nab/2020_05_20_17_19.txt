If you you don't believe me then I suggest trawling though any of the Business programmes on the television and news outlets.China is embargoing (or threatening to) only discretionary items - food, wine and maybe in education - things it can produce, source elsewhere or are just luxuries.Iron ore is safe - more so as Brazil is having difficulties in supply.

I have a tendency to agree with you.  A $1.00 discount to current share price is not that much considering the risk uptake.  It's no secret that banks will take considerable time to rally upwards, and there are many economic factors that have yet to be factored into their share price.  NAB is well exposed to residential housing loans, and although the economy "may" swing back into action quickly, the damage has been done.  This is not even taking into account present and possible future trade embargoes by China (barley, coal, iron ore) and possible extended unemployment.Still, as indicated earlier, NAB is NOT folding and the bank will climb back eventually.  This is why I believe the outlook is 3-5 years.I'd be interested in hearing other people's viewpoint.
