Unfortunately we don’t hold enough shares to make a difference.in my view when such scandals get found out their should be a claw back on all executive bonuses paid during said periods, with a time lapse I’d say 10 years. That’ll make them think twice about it, ie their money effected instead of just us mug shareholders. Prior executives making off like bandits with no consequences
