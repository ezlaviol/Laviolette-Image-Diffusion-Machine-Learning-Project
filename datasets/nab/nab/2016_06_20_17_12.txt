2016-06-20T17:12:00+10:00 : Well (non gender specific) Guys, there's another 3rd standard deviation move from CBA with the other banks not far behind. I think we're supposed to get about ten of them a year. And there's been two in five days.

Geeze if we get Brexit we get Boris Johnson as Cameron will surely resign, and if we get Trump too, the hair of both these loonies together would be too much for the market to handle.

I reckon we are now pricing in no Brexit which probably only gives the SP another 1.5% or so tops, 1.23% from Friday June 10th in NAB's case. 

Remember the Brexpanic took hold overseas that Friday night and we only had four trading days last week which makes last week even more remarkable. Banks were a bit jittery on the 10th but there was quite a rally mid morning even if we did close down. So we're almost where we were pre Brexpanic.

Anyway, that's starting to sound too logical for the market. There's probably a bit more risk to the down side as polling showing a swing to Leave will surely spook the cattle whereas good news for Remain may  already be priced in now.

I tend to think that bank stocks were on the rise a couple of weeks ago but are still stuck in a trading range- which is just great for us here on HC I think 

Whatever the case, buy the rumour and sell the fact plus  buy the dips and sell the rallies is probably as relevant as ever this year.

Again, too logical for the market of course.
