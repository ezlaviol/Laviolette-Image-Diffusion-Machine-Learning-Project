2020-06-20T16:11:00+10:00 : I see your point. However I don’t think this is like the GFC, the short term impact is worse, however money markets haven’t frozen like the gfc, it’s actually the opposite as governments acted early with unprecedented liquidity. Which is why I see a quick recovery unless a second wave comes. If this turns out to be as bad as the Spanish flu with a second wave mutation then I 100% agree this will be like the gfc or worse with new lows.hope not! Because I’ll need to leverage to take new substantial positions. I’m not really a trader too, what I buy is generally locked away. Non core sure, I’ll sell out along the way, however big name blue chips I don’t tend to ever sell.
