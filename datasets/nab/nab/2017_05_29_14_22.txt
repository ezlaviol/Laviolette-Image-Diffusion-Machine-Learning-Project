2017-05-29T14:22:00+10:00 : Yes, it has broken the setup on Friday and $29.68.

Plan A is still ok however. It is oversold and should buy today on this weakness. If down more tomorrow, then buy more.

There will be a bounce to $30.60 at least.

The large fall however does indicate that gains since November 2016 from $26 to $34 were too exuberant. If fall in banks continues straight down, then indication and fear that gains in property and popularity of property, especially past 1 year, is ending.

Interesting that WBC can very easily revisit last June lows of $28. Which is 6.5% away.

Apply a fall of 6.5% to NAB at today's price of $29.35 and you get $27.45. Which is way higher than NAB's last June low of $24.

I think NAB has been growing. It also has the highest earning power for its current price.

Yes, I feel more downside to the banks in the weeks ahead with WBC revisit to last years lows of $28 and NAB to $27's.

Still, a good stock to buy, short term, medium and long term.
