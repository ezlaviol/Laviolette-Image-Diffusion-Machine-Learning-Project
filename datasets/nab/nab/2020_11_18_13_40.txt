Sure it is painful but at least with the dividends and a reasonable chance of recovery with the lifting of COVID 19 issues it is a possibility you can accept.  In the meantime, I urge all shareholders to vote AGAINST the re-election of Directors and vote AGAINST the remuneration  resolution.That will keep the Board and CEO and their toes!
