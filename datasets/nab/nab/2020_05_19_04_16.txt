2020-05-19T04:16:00+10:00 : well waiting 5 years to make 100% or $180,000 profit is dismal profitably in my opinion. Ild rather sell when the short term chart says over bought and  buy them back when it says over sold. in this market Ild expect it to happen quite often. $1.50 is equivalent to $18,000 with 12,000 shares and to watch that dwindle away within a 4 week period would be irresponsible and quite frankly stupid.
