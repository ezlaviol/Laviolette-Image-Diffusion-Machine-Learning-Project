2020-06-02T10:37:00+10:00 : Rubbish! The only holders to get diluted are those that didn't apply (they get diluted whoever gets the shares) or those with large enough holdings that the max allowable of $30,000 isn't enough to keep pace.
Please show an instance where others have been diluted?
(In fact some with very small holdings that have recd min allocation have improved their position)
Small holders that tried to double or triple their holding through a discounted purchase plan then complaining about scale back is ridiculous.
