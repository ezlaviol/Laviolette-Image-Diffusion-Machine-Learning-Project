2022-08-09T12:07:00+10:00 : " the big four "  ?....over the past 10 years....CBA share price is up 88%versus 28% for NAB ,  negative 6% for ANZ and negative 10% for WBC....since 1992    CBA share price is up 1400%   versus 334% for NAB and 650% for ANZ and WBCNAB, ANZ and WBC dividends in 2021  were smaller than 10 years ago but CBA's were higher (  $3.50  in 2021 versus $3.32 in 2012 ) the outlook forward is debatable but I don't think you can lump all the banks together over the past 2 or 3 decades.which is why I continue to stay away from 3 of them as long term investment.
