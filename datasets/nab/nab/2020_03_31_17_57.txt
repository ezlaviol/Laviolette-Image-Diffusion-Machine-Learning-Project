Not really for 2 of the Big 4, does not look good reputationally either.Everyone hates the Docklands white elephant stadium as well IMHO just see the last lord mayoralty election for that. the AFL own a white elephant stadium, the security on that is much worst than the old VFL Park out at Waverly.
