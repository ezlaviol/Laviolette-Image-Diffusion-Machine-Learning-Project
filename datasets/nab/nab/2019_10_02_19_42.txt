2019-10-02T19:42:00+10:00 : NAB could probably do another 2.6% fall tomorrow, there appears to be no buyers anymore which is presumably because of five reasons:1) NIM is now looking to be lower for longer and for NAB may never recover, same as for CBA2) Underemployment, unemployment, wages, property prices and the overall Australian economy appear stuffed 3) the governance, risk and compliance at NAB appears completely stuffed before Ross McEwen 4) the appointment of Ross McEwen is now being perceived badly by the market as a cost cutter is not what is needed 5) the RBA, regulators and politicians may not accept NABâ€™s position, the 15 BP call compared to the 25 Bp RBA cut was political suicide and NAB appears to be politically suiciding itself
