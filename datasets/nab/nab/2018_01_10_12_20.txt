Fact is, the market, as we know, is driven by emotion - greed, fear etc etc.  - not sensibility and balance sheets.
There's a RC on, in case you hadn't noticed? and the financial sector has been a political football to get Shorten elected for a while now. Mud sticks, and bank bashing has stymied the Sp's on all the big 4 because of nervousness. In addition, they've all dropped overseas plays and now fighting for the same domestic dollar in Oz. They'll be winners and losers in this. 
Just like the good' ole aviation days when tataars (TAA) and Ansett used to run around the country like siamese twins - sooner or later, they get separated!!
