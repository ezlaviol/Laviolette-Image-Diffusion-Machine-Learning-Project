I think there might be some bungee jumping in the big 4's share prices on Tuesday. It is difficult or near impossible to pick the bottom. There will be plenty of investors like me ready to pounce on any significant dip.My plan is to average in over Tuesday then hold for many years enjoying the up side and juicy dividends. Tuesday could be the best buying opportunity investors will get in the foreseeable future to acquire a quality gold star stock, being NAB at a fantastic entry price. DYOR.My sentiment is Hold if you already own them and BUY next week if you are in the market for a quality stock. Good luck - Prosperous investing. (expect the unexpected as that's what markets do)
