However, for the last 3-6 months the Speculative/small cap end if the ASX has been in a 'once in a generation' bull market. After 25+ yrs in the market, this is probably the third time I've witnessed this and I've learnt that it's very, very important to make hay while that opportunity presents. 

It's also very important to not get greedy, and as you say avoid holding the baby too long.

Move the stale capital into a hot position, grow it by 50%-150% and then move it back into a defensive position and/or cash. 

The gains I'm making right now with that money are putting me in a position to begin semi retirement 20-25yrs ahead of schedule. Worth the risk.
