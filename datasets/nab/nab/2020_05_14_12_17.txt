I’m personally not into charting because a company will always take its own individual path to either greatness or detriment (that is my opinion obviously as I know many that follow Elliot waves etc and fully respect them) IMO banks have bottomed, and if they continued to go lower it’s just because people can’t see a once in a lifetime opportunity when it stares them in the face. good luck to you all. I’m off buying banks for the rest of the year!
