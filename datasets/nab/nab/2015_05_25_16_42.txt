2015-05-25T16:42:00+10:00 : MAte I dont hold shares - i get them from working for the group, (that's occasionally haha) so I know what the company is going through, theres nothing wrong with the offer - im just not interrested in buying small parcels in a company going sideways - im not sure whether they will drop that far but on the other hand they never go up that much - so the only reason for holding would be for dividends and that's a 100k holding to make it worthwhile
