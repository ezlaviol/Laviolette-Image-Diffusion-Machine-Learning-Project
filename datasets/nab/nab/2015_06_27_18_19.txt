Within the terms of the prospectus, redemption is at 100 dollars.
They are unlikely to be redeemed for the reasons above.
However, they may, and I stress may, go thru the same process as sunhb or benhb,both getting and offer to be bought back at a premium to their market value, but not at par.
If you look at the these 2 , they have very similar terms to the nabha's.

But even if the par value is very unlikely, a possible offer 10 to 15% above its market price, and a reasonable running yield , these, and the mblhb's worth having[have both].
