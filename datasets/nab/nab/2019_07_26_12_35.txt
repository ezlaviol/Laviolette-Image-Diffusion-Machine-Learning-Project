2019-07-26T12:35:00+10:00 : Financials set to rise 1.8% this week Miners on track for biggest weekly decline since May 	Australian shares fell on Friday after three straight sessions of gains, with declines led by tech stocks and financials as investors registered disappointment with European Central Bank putting off an interest rate cut until probably September.	   	The S&P/ASX 200 index  (xjo)  fell 0.4% or 23.9 points to 6,794.10 by 0155 GMT. The benchmark rose 0.6% on Thursday and was set to gain 1.2% for the week.

The focus is now squarely on what the U.S. Federal Reserve decides next week at a policy committee meeting, with expectations running high for a cut in rates.

Tech stocks  .AXIJ  dropped 1.6%, in line with Wall Street peers that fell after disappointing results from chipmakers, and social media giant Facebook warned that new rules and product changes aimed at protecting user privacy would slow its revenue growth into next year.
