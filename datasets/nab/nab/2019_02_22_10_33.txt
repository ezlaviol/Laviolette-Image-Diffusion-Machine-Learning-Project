2019-02-22T10:33:00+11:00 : Sorry Kevo88 for your burst...Here is my take.... If a company profit goes down by 50% but still profitable, does it entitle a CEO for Excessive Paypackage ? Answer is NO..NAB has gone in gutter from being the Biggest Bank of Australia down to Smallest Bank among the top four. Who is responsible for Degrading the Value over two decades. Same CEO and Exective who has probably taken home almost several Billions in Salary and Bonues...Why did they receive Bonus while NAB gone from being Largest Bank to Smallest Bank ? ? ?..Feeding More Penuts to Monkey's Does not turn them into Smarter
