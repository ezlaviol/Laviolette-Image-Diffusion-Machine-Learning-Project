Market is forward looking.Any chatter about a dilution of Nab shareholdiing that hasnt already been factored in is just plain silly.  posters on HC do not influence share prices, the large institutions do.  And does anyone think that Nab would do something untoward to bite the hand that provides them with liquidity ?  they would lose trust simple as that. the SPP HAS been set at half a Bil.  Yes, it may be more but not enough to surprise the market.
