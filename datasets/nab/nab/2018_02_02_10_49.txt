However, if you are convinced like me that NAB is buy at these levels and knowing that they will next report in May with dividend due in July, my advice is simply settle on a price entry point that you are happy with. 

Say $8.8o....then stick to your plan and buy on the dips. It will, in my view dip again below $9 (Royal Commission issues and DOW likely to be volatile soon). Stick to your buy strategy and donâ€™t try to panic buy because it is rising, you need to be patient.....
