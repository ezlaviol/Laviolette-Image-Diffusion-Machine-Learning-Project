2017-12-11T18:26:00+11:00 : The extract from Gindaldan, reads like the majority of market comments from August 2008

(a major oops of mine)

IF not for Gindaldan's following words could become nervous !

Any who are puzzled, need explanation of external shocks
a brief outline here  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007â€“2008 

Agree that Australian housing likely to stagnate or fall, though not collapse.

This mostly due impact of financial collapse on those in government&opposition, where may be to high for them to "bear" .

Our RBA has working hard to ensure Australians more ready for a housing price collapse, pushing banks to "renegotiate"  loans at higher risk.

US based commentators do not understand the impact, the benefit, our RBA receives from the loans not being throw away keys & debt style as caused the problems in USA, that impacted on rest of world.

Serious issue with problems is their timing, often they come together.
