2018-10-15T04:58:00+11:00 : The share prices in the short term will follow the overseas market . The mid term elections are 6 November and there will be some me chaos. This will be the major mover on the Aussie market. My guess is there will be more down says than up in the run up to the midterms, the stock goes ex div shortly after in 8 November. I will buy at 25 which should happen on a down day. I expect the share price in 12 months I be where it is now. But of course on a “13 month view “ you will bank $3 in dividends
