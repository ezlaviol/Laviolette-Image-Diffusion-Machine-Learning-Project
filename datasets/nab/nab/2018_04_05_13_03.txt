2018-04-05T13:03:00+10:00 : I remember learning in economics at school a theory. This theory was called the "Too Big to Fail" Theory.
Its concept is that the big banks support our entire economy and are interlinked to other countries on a global scale. Without banks you have no intermediary for lenders and borrowers and the economy basically collapses. As such IMO the bank system will be around long after we all come to pass.

We also need to remember that the big banks got together and requested the RC themselves. This was again IMO because in the current market (uncertainty high) they have had enough and want to get it out of the way.

Personally don't see the banks falling as far back as $22. But I think there will be some more short term pain for the banks before they can roll up their sleeves and get back to business. As such IMO wouldn't buy but wouldn't sell.
