2020-05-19T15:16:00+10:00 : NAB been the worst of the big 4. Not denying it, but in a large portfolio you need to spread risk across all 4. CBA been the best by far, however haven’t bought a share since the last rights issue around $70 or so. Can’t remember exactly.My view is the big 3 (not cba), will be back to $20 within 6 months. Have taken up the SPP in $30kx2 in 2 accounts and $15k in smsf which is near empty in cash. Will do personal name for myself and wife tomorrow pending no market crash.
