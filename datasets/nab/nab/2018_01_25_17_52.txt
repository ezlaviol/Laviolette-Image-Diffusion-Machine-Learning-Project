2018-01-25T17:52:00+11:00 : Huh?? That's your prediction not mine
You stated in your post which I quoted:-

"I'm also hoping for $31 by march. ..................Hopefully all time high by April just before dividend period."

Nab touched a bit under $43 around 11/2007. Now granted that was before sale of CYB so I guess you could take a $1 per share or so off, but even so, I just thought it a very bullish prediction......................
ps - i would be very happy if it hit all time highs in April, but I certainly don't think that will happen.
