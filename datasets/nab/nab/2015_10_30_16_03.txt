2015-10-30T16:03:00+11:00 : Closing auction is not looking good. I think NAB's short term share price fate depends on what the RBA does on Tuesday.  If there is no rate cut it will get firmly smashed below $30 IMO or soar to the recent highs if they cut. As someone else mentioned the big boys are playing these banks from the long and short side and this week shorting the banks is the game.
