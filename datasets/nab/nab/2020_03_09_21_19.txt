It’s absolutely great that China maybe slowly returning to normal but if the global demand for their output is diminished through recessionary influences then China growth itself is challenged. With interest rates at prevailing low levels there is minimal monetary stimulus available to central banks around the world. Whether the driver for these recessionary concerns is COVID itself I’m not smart enough to know.
