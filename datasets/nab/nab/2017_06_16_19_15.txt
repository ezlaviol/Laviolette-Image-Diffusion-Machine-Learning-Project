Clearly it would be peanuts compared to revenue collected from the big four, but it's hard to understand how/why very big foreign banks should be allowed to dabble in our market without paying the same dues.

I can understand the reasoning behind excluding smaller Aussie banks from the new tax, but not the big foreign competitors.
