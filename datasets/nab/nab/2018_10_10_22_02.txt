I can't see NAB having big write downs as they've already had the big overseas clean out and simplified their business model. It really comes down to what your looking for in an investment. While the banks are relatively cheap investing in them now means you are accepting they are going to be tracking sideways for a while and your basically going to get paid a good fully yield to wait for a catalyst that breaks them out of the malaise (in the case of NAB the MLC demerger might cause a value uplift but i'm unsure as to how that demerger will be structured). I try and go into an investment classifying it as either an "income" pick or a "growth" pick and my overall portfolio is pretty conservative and weighted as about 65 percent income and 35 percent growth. As an income pick I am more than happy with NAB at these prices and if anything the sideways movement just gives me an opportunity to gradually build the holding up over the next 12 months.
