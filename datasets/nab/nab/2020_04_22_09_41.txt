The death rate is really the only figure worth comparing and importantly this is where Aus is very low. Saw an interview with a Swedish resident and she stated there was voluntary type lock downs with many scared and doing whatever they could. The concerning thing with Sweden is their numbers continue to grow and death rate (per million pop) has now climbed to 175 (total deaths now 1,765) Australia currently 3 deaths per m.  While these figures still lag behind the worst of the EU countries I don't think Sweden should be held up as an example of what to do and only time will tell in regard to long term psychological problems. There would be absolute uproar if our Gov let things drift and our death rate was in the thousands
I think the Aus Government is very aware they cannot keep these lock downs going for too long with such low numbers. People will start to ignore and of course economic rationale will also come into it. I think they will be announcing less restrictive measures regularly to appease people and also try and ensure transmission remains low. 
Strict control of borders will obviously remain in place much longer.
