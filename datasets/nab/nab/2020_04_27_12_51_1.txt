2020-04-27T12:51:00+10:00 : Yep, each to their own, horses for courses, etc, but those stocks listed by @eric341,  ALU, TNE, NXT, MP1, XRO, seem like fairly solid growth stocks to me, ALU and TNE pay reasonably good divs too, not sure about the others.Fortunately, out of the blue chips I only hold CSL (38% of portfolio) and out of those eric341 mentioned, ALU (16% of portfolio), wish I'd bought TNE a long time ago, although I do hold an equivalent quality one, MAQ (31% of portfolio).GLTAH of all holders of NAB and the other banks, things are starting to look a bit grim, or should that be grimmer.
