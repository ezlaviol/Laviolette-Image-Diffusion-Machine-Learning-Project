2016-02-25T16:32:00+11:00 : 2 weeks ago we had a low price 0f $23.82 and today we came close to it with $34.01  but then it turned back to $24.55 so im thinking maybe the SP has found the bottom perhaps the turning point for the sp begins now.
i noticed alot of buying activity once the sp got near $24 so i think  it might not pass that point..
on the nab chart it shows the trend to start looking like its flattening out so maybe time will tell.
