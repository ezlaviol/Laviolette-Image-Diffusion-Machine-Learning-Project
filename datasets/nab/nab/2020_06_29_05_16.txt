2020-06-29T05:16:00+10:00 : Unfortunately, we are currently living in a world of uncertainty - and normal market logic is not paramount.I still am trying to be optimistic though. Volatility will be with us for the next six months and we will see up and downs - particularly in the banking sector.None of our collective crystal balls will be of much use. Bank shares are likely to dip today as the DOW finished off badly on Friday and the US virus situation has been quite bad over the week end as well.I do wonder though whether there has been the shock - and a partial recovery of sorts and maybe we are approaching the bottom - maybe NAB could retreat to $17 but that there is also upward impetus as well in the short/medium term. When there is some sort of ordinary day, we are getting 2-3% SP rises in bank shares - and that is not a normal situation.
