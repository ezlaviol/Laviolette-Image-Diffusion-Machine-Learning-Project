I am of the opinion that the British sell off will have "20/30%" floated to that market, the largest holder then being the prime manager / owner of the company in Britain. My understanding is the rest will be distributed to existing share holders, something like the demerger of Henderson from AMP. This is my understanding, please tell me if I'm wrong. Any input please.............. Cheers Puckeye.
