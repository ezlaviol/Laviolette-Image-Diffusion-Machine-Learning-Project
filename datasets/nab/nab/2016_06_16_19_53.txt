On a serious note, I just don't see NAB getting into trouble at the moment. Sure there is no room for lots of growth but I don't see any huge threats. Their income stream seems secure, I don't think the bad debts will rise significantly. Commodities seems to have stabilized so I don't think any mining companies will be falling over soon, etc.
As already discussed I think the so called housing bubble is significantly overplayed. Even the media are starting to admit this (see http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-...ebt-risk-growing-says-sp-20160615-gpjbxg.html). While interests rates are low, and this looks likely to continues at least for the next five years, I don't see mortgage defaults as a threat.  
Everyone was so badly burnt in 2008, that just the thought of a downturn causes panic. Panic causes volatility which can be good for some, but not if you buy high and panic sell low.
Of course I could well be wrong and the banks will crash and burn. Time will tell, but I think they are safer than most.
