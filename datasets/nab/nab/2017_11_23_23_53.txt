I prefer CBA long term but am too nervous to hold until the money laundering issue is settled. So I'm not holding CBA right now.

I like NAB also LT, but I see NAB as more of a "buy on dips & reap the yield" because the yield is quite strong if you buy at the right price. It's been a very safe defensive stock.

Beyond those, I prefer to go for some kind of listed investment trust because generally those funds will do a better job of investing for returns than I will.
