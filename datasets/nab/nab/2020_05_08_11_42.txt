2020-05-08T11:42:00+10:00 : For reference I applied for the full $47K in the Auckland Airport and only got less than 20% of that allocated in the SPP. The market moved up in the time after I sold and as a result I missed out on those gains on the remaining $40K odd that was refunded to me. I suspect the NAB raising will be massively over subscribed the only question is by how will NAB increase the SPP.
