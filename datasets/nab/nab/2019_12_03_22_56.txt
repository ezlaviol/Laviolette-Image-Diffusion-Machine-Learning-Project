2019-12-03T22:56:00+11:00 : Still in the black on my purchases from earlier this year.There's an argument that I could have sold,  but I have a long term strategy that includes CGT discounts (if I ever sell) and my marginal personal tax rate dropping from 37% to 30% in the next couple of years.Long game.
