2023-05-08T02:09:00+10:00 : Nothing wrong with selling out before a weekend, makes good sense and i usually always do but i think there is a few more legs in NAB for a trade and if worst case i get a 6.5% div with capital gain on a trade then jobs done.Another GFC is coming, there is no doubt about that, but i still dont see that black swan swimming around as yet even with regionals in the US. Fractional banking is a very big concern and that could be that Swan right in front of my eyes playing out ever so slowly...dunno yet....it might very well be, but whilst my numbers keep stacking up i keep trading until such time.Well done and good trade mate.RDD
