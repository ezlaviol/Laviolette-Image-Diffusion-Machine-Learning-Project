2023-05-04T21:18:00+10:00 : NAB missed all their market estimates, earnings, dividends, NIM.Given this reporting period was supposed to be peak profit cycle, I think the share price will come under further pressure.In addition NAB will be a potential candidate for end of FY tax loss selling.Historically the months of May and June have been negative months for the banks (net negative return on average over 20 yrs on average)NAB will trade ex dividend next week, but I think share price could drop further than the dividend amount after ex-dividendSo keeping an eye but with a view to creating a first position in mid-late June.
