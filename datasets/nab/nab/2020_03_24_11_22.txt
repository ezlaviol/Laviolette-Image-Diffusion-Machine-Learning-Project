2020-03-24T11:22:00+11:00 : I was thinking the same thing.
I am naturally positive and optimistic, but this has the potential to make the GFC look like a small blip.

There will be well over one million unemployment applications in the USA this week, more likely two milllion or even higher. The record during the GFC was 600k.

And lets not forget debt levels are significantly higher AND companies are not bringing any cash right now and no doubt there will be a rush of bankruptcies. The economies of the world did not shut down during the GFC.
