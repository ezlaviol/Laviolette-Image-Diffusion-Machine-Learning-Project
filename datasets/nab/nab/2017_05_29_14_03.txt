2017-05-29T14:03:00+10:00 : DRP = Dividend Reinvestment Plan; offered by most big ASX companies (e.g. NAB) as an automatic system where your divvy payments are not paid in cash but instead paid to you as an equivalent number of NAB shares. 

The reason I favour DRP is because as an automated system it ensures you are re-investing every divvy payment over time and this is the critical thing. Those divvy payments MUST be reinvested to achieve a compounding (growth) effect.

Some investors prefer to take the divvy in cash and do the re-investing themselves. Nothing wrong with that as long as the re-investing happens.
I prefer to set and forget with a DRP.
