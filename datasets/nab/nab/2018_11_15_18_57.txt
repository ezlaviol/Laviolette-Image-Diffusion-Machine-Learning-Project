2018-11-15T18:57:00+11:00 : Hi All,I'm new to the stock markets, like the greenest green you have ever seen. Can anyone explain what this document means? I've ready it several times now and from what I can understand. It's like a dividend AUD 0.80405479 per share, and we get paid on the Friday February 15, 2019. Assuming we still have securities in NAB on the Wednesday January 30, 2019. I thought companies mainly issue dividends twice a year. Or is this like a minor dividend, it did say it wasn't Franked. Any help would be appreciated to turn a green fella a lighter shade of green.
