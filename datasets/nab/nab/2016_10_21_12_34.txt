NAB looks the best on a number of metrics when looking at the big 4 banks.. They're historic indicators, so a drop in div would affect these figures obviously.

Another way to look at this though, is that NAB could lower the dividend payout and come back in line with the other players in the sector, however there would be pressure to maintain the dividend and I have found recent announcements encouraging.
In the pat 12 months NAB has divested of CYB and recently completed the sale of most of its life insurance arm to focus on the main Australian business. Lots of capital and lots of cash so they can return it to shareholders via the div.

Go back and read the half-year results, it's encouraging. Fingers crossed they maintain 0.99, it would communicate they are firmly in control and executing on their strategy (which I believe they are.)
