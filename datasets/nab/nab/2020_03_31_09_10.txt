It's a business decision, not a gift. Otherwise I'm sure in 10 years time it will have proved a shrewd move with a nice consistent income coming from it.As for professional sporting impacts, that's for the league to fix not their bank. Furthermore to assume the bank isn't helping out landlords and tenants is naiive. And to then imply that they can't do both of these things concurrently is even more ridiculous.
