2020-05-17T10:25:00+10:00 : There's been a lot of discussion about a rethink of the 4 pillars banking policy that Keating and Costello made...does it really ensure a competitive banking market??We've seen quite a few mergers..Westpac taking over St George bank in 2008, and bank of Melbourne, bankSA etcIf things really hit the fan later this year, then perhaps it will really test the 4 pillar policy....mergers generally benefit all shareholders.
