You can only order in a pre-determined $ value, ie $1,000, $2,500, $10,000..... $30,000.My beef is that none of the pre-determined amounts appear to be equally divisible by $14.15. I didn't check them all but the ones I did check were not equally divisible. I do get it that everyone's orders will be scaled back but would it not have been more sensible to make the pre-determined amounts equally divisible, ie $1,004.65, $2,504.55 etc?
