Likewise the AFL had been making enough of a profit that they bought out their stadium years earlier than planned, which is how they are likely securing this loan. I don't give a flying shit what Robert Doyle wanted to do with the joint, who cares. NAB and ANZ could have the place torn down and redeveloped for huge profits and great return on investment if it came to it. Your opinion on the league is blurring you view on this decision as a business decision. The bias shows.As for tv rights and broadcasting, they may not be sustainable into the future but again, not a NAB problem but rather an AFL problem, post that on their stock thread.
