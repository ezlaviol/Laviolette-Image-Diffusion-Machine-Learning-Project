2020-12-16T00:35:00+11:00 : Where to? PE ratio of 21 and dividend yield of 2%.. This has rallied to precovid rates with a reduced dividend, economic uncertainties, increased competition, higher defaults, lower interest receipts.. The writing is on the wall, cash in... it's glaringly obvious that the bank/travel stocks have recovered too quickly. The risks outweigh the benefits of holding it past here, the downside would be higher than you achieving a yearly high of $27?
