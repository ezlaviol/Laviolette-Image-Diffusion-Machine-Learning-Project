Next target is $22.50 if it gets there. Then if it hits close to $22 I'd take a small stab at $22.01 just I case it doesn't go under 22. If it goes under 22 then just small parcels spaces far enough apart to have an effect on my average. Tbh I think it's got f all chance of getting anywhere near $20. If it does, instead of 250 parcels I'll be buying 1k parcels. My 25.50 nab got missed on Friday even though it hit my price. Next week will hopefully bring some more focused selling of the banks. Next target $22.50, $22.01 then depending on resistance I might take a larger holding around $21.80ish. If it still looks like it's being targeted I would wait for a $21 target. Under that ill be playing it on the fly. I'm also looking for an under $25 price on nab. and I just realized this is an nab thread which I'm posting mostly ANZ. MODS I'm making nab comment as well
