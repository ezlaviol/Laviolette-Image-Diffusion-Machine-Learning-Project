2020-03-17T11:03:00+11:00 : GFC comparatively had minimal impact to most people and many businesses.  Life went on. People travelled, ate out, went to the footy, had no fear of family or friends going to intensive care or worse.  The contrast with now where inumerable businesses face huge cash flow issues or other disruptions and any person could think of multiple family and friends with age or health issues that could die could not be greater.  How many nurses do you know? What if they end up looking after coronavirus patients 8 hours a day 5 days a week?  Might the viral load be too much for them as was the case in china and now italy.Hope for the best but don't make light of it.
