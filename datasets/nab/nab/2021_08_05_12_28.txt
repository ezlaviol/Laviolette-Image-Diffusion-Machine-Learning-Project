2021-08-05T12:28:00+10:00 : many didn’t buy nab at $14 because it was a gamble then - who knew what kind of virus that was ravenously spreading through the worlds population? Who knew the economical impact? Risk of war? Risk of economic collapse? Risk of personal / family death? Now, in hindsight, at $26, we know the impacts of the virus, we can take a calculated risk because we see the balance between what has been and was is most likely to happen next. So simply - at $14 it was $14 because it was a gamble - a very risky gamble indeed. At $26 it is $26 because it is a very sensible, calculated risk. So with that, it’s up to everyone to chose when to buy in, however, to buy bank shares today or 18 months ago, it’s a world different, I’d say, it’s beyond compare.
