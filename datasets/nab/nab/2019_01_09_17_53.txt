2019-01-09T17:53:00+11:00 : Buying under $23 a couple of weeks ago may have been a great buy to some.

I'm just not convinced the latest run since $22.84 will have enough gusto in it long term. There is still so much uncertainty in our economy and politics.

I'd love to see this go back to and under $22.84 for me to buy again. Reason being, I expect the divvie to be reduced in next 12+ months. 

The next few earnings seasons should be an interesting one!! Anyone expecting profit downgrades in 2019?
