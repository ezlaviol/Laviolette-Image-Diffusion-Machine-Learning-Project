How about supporting your claim? If it's 'clearly a downtrend' it shouldn't be too hard.

Some people round here have felt attacked lately however I'm simply trying to elevate the conversation. Open up you analysis for review.

There are too many blowhards around here that make calls with very little to support it or demonstrate how they came up with it. Not suggesting you're one, I just want to see how you formed that opinion.

I'm looking at MACD, a trailing indicator that is currently almost 0, i reckon the DT could be over for the reasons I mentioned previously.
