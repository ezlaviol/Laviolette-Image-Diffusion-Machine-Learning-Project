2018-01-20T01:07:00+11:00 : Peeps, this is going to $28 I've already staked my left nut on it and I already lost the other one to a workplace incident during my adult film industry career. So I can't really afford to lose this bet.

But the question is: Will it go BELOW $28?

Answer: Maybe. It's impossible to say with any certainty but I'll give it 60% probability of hitting $27 and maybe even $26 but no lower unless we see a GFC type black swan event.

Reasoning: NAB is a dog. I'm sorry to be so harsh with the name calling but the ASX has been very strong, DJIA going gangbusters, and NAB can't crack $30. What's going to happen if even a baby size piece of poo hits the fan?

Yep, brown spots everywhere.
