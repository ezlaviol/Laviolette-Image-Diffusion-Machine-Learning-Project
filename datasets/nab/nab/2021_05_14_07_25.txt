2021-05-14T07:25:00+10:00 : The 'Livewire' blog has two fundies discussing the 'big four' banks.Interestingly, both rate NAB the best:Best of the Big Four: National Australia Bank (ASX:NAB)Matthew Haupt (BUY): It'd be National Australia Bank. Done a lot of work in the background, pulled out costs, reduced products, straight-through processing. All that hard work has been done and we're starting to see the signs of that hard work coming through the results. Probably in the last month or two of the result, a very encouraging sign. So, NAB for me is a clear winner in the Aussie banks.James Marlay: Okay. Scott, you're number one pick out of the big four. Can you give me the pitch and then tell me why you like it?Scott Olsson (BUY): Sure. It's also NAB for the reasons that Matt outlined, but alongside that as well, I think what they're doing on costs, they're not short-terming the business. I think they're investing enough alongside pulling out costs. So, that should enable them to take advantage of some revenue opportunities. And the business environment finally looks like there might be a bit of growth coming out of that, which is where NAB really plays and it does its best work.
