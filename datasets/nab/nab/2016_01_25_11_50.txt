2016-01-25T11:50:00+11:00 : SYDNEY, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Australian business conditions showed a slight easing in December but stayed strong for a fifth straight month with sales, profits and employment remaining in positive territory, a survey reported on Monday. 	National Australia Bank's (NAB) monthly survey of more than 500 firms showed its index of business conditions slipped 3 points to +7 in December, but that was still above average. 	Capacity utilisation, a measure of the underlying health of the economy, fell to 80 percent from 80.8 percent, NAB noted. 	Business confidence also eased back to +3 from +5 in November, holding in positive territory despite growing worries about global growth and large declines in oil prices. 	"Positive business conditions in most industries suggest a relatively broad-based recovery in the non-mining sector is underway with services leading the way, although the deterioration in construction will be monitored closely," said NAB's chief economist Alan Oster.
