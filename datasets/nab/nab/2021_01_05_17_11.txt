1.  CommSec is #1 for cheap and pretty useful research, don't have to do minimum trades to retain access to live prices/depth (I think).

2.  SelfWealth is good when you get more solid in your positions $-wise - $9.50 brokerage on big trades (say over 20k) is better value, although some aspects of the web and mobile platform are deficient IMHO. Bonus is pretty easy US market access, which is fast becoming de riguer.

3.  Superhero now emulating that with the $5.00 flat fee (DYOR on whether you get an actual HIN)

4.  Robinhood - who knows when it will be in Aus? What will it be?

For as long as I know, CommSec have been the legends in this space. Back in the day you could have your cash in CommSec's CDIA account and actually get OK interest (not the highest available, but passable).  Nobody pays any interest nowadays.  But at least with CommSec you can buy on credit (T+2 is your deadline to stump up the cash or Sell something to contra the requirement). With these others you generally need the cash in their hands to place a deal.

I'm ignoring CFD Margin players such as IG and CMC but DYOR if you're interested in leveraged products - care required though. Stockpot and others have way too much control of your affairs and I wouldn't feel safe with them.

Good Luck

PS it's good to have several broker accounts for when an arbitrage comes along and you are allowed to use multiple HINs. (rare but nice)
