Theoretical because when you have OPM in play like super funds they dont really care too much when they buy it because its not their $. Price rises and falls can be manufactured to suit, then throw shorters into the mix and value investing becomes somewhat irrelevant but the sentiment helps. Then of course we have the high frequency traders with their hands in your pockets without anyones permission all the time, they are the etag you never asked for or the brokerage fee on top of the brokerage. So many variables beyond dividend timing. The share price really just is what it is......
