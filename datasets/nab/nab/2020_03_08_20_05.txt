2020-03-08T20:05:00+11:00 : After a while  people become " numbed out"  listening every day to another  revised figure for the global spread and it eventually becomes un-newsworthy.    Rationality then eventually becomes the order of the day.    Eventually, by a few months,  we will get some believable mortality rates given some doubts presently about Chinese figures.  Anecdotally already we know its relatively higher in old people or those of poor health, the issue will be what about the remainder if the population. If indeed its around 2% , and influenza is something under 1%, ( SARS was 9.6%)   then the fear factor subsides somewhat.  I have been topping up at current panic prices, not only NAB but other yield stocks as well.  Long term holds for me, I'll bet in a years time   covid 19 stats will not be on the front page just as SARs  is not.
