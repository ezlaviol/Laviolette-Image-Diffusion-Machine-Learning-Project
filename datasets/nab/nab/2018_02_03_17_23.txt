Thanks for your time recently.

Further to our conversation we have looked further into your claim in regards to the buy order for Auscann Group Holdings Ltd (AC8) on the 4th of January 2018.

Your call was taken by our client service associate ...... who offered to place the trade over the phone for you – your initial order that was placed over the phone was for 2,000 units of AC8 @ $0.965c.

Please see the attached screenshots of the order trail for your order as after we placed the trade for 2,000 units (in which the 2,000 units executed at your desired price) you had proceeded to amend the order 7 times.

Unfortunately due to the initial 2,000 units being filled at the price and volume you originally requested we won’t be looking into any compensation amount in regards to the additional 1,400 units you had added to the order after the manual order was placed.

However due to the inconvenience caused that day and your patience whilst we have investigated your enquiry we are happy to offer you 5 free trades (capped @ $29.95 and valid for 90 days
