2020-04-05T09:33:00+10:00 : @Squirrel88 Just watching the analysis on job keeper on TV - I notice that you are not a fan.Do you not think that this idea has some merit - from your  viewpoint of small/medium businesses? Be very interested in your opinion on this. I think the government is pinning their hopes on this policy so you biews would be most welcome.In regard to NAB dividends, I am getting less optimistic about whether the next one will be paid - but, if they are, there will be a significant reduction. I also agree with Garlic Minched that it may be prudent under the current circumstances to withhold the mid year dividend.

I completely agree with you garlic munched, having just made 20 employees redundant across 3 shops for the small cough of economic death we had to have....I sure as heck now won’t be paying these debts as to do this you need an open business! I suspect this may be similar with other business who also deal with bank loans. As for job keeper, what a joke this isn’t even functional beyond a button of hope. This is a government initiated economic meltdown down that most likely won’t end well.
