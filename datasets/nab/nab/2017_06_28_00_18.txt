2017-06-28T00:18:00+10:00 : I haven't been here for a while. To answer your question Superwealthy, yes, I have been involved with NAB since late May and still holding. Maneuvering through the ups and downs and sometimes making use of the volatility. Swinging from a position of $-17k to +$7k. Good experience being involved with hard cash during the up and down price action.

Looking at the chart and the price action this is my take on it: The banks and NAB in particular have spend 1 month shedding dollars and doing a "rough" adjustment and then a further 1 month to do a fine adjustment and in form a floor during the range we saw from $30.40 to $29.04. I had expected at least $30.60 during these bounces but it couldn't quite achieve that. During the past month and this range time, very clear and solid positive divergence has been formed on the RSI, DMI and MFI as shown in the chart.

From today's and the past few days price action we see multiple tests of $29.00 (around 9 times). The stock is aware of both the federal tax and the SA tax and the potential for WA tax and perhaps other states taxes, it is aware of the scary talk on housing bubbles, warnings by agencies, downgrades and yet it hasn't broken $29 on the 9 or so occasions it has tested. So, I now feel (in the short term, 3 weeks) a floor has formed and there is limited downside in the short term. For now, I think the banks will go up around 5% to 8% into July where $30.60 will now be achieved for NAB and potentially up to $31.50. Enough time has past where good work has been done on the chart (2 months), financial year ending soon and seasonality (July is seasonally better) are some reasons.

However, once this corrective rally ends, I feel it is back down to under $29. Possibly $28.50, $27.80 and if things get really nasty bearish, I wouldn't rule out $24. It is certainly not a buy and hold into the next few months scenario. Buy and hold is later on in the year around November, December where fund managers will be ready to buy banks again.

Example, I feel we are at September 28, 2015 in the chart. Providing $29 holds in the next few sessions, we should get some rise here. My opinion only.
