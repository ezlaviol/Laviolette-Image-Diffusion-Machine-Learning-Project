I never said you shouldn't have an opinion, I actually addressed your points specifically because to be frank there was no coherent message and I am perplexed at your continued focus on single issues to support your dire warnings  on NAB.
If you notice I did not offer any goldilocks defence or support of NAB so not sure why the optimist comment (and making it sound derisory)
Perhaps if you wish to address the specific issues I and others have raised it might carry a bit more weight than a defensive reply that apparently just seems to say "mark my words" even though I have no idea what you are actually saying!!
(Although it appears you are now mainly concerned about cash raisings, not so much the end of the world because of the likes of Afterpay)
BTW - not sure what age has to do with it - you have no idea how old I am..............
