This has been well documented over the past year.  ZIRP has limited economic stimulus value as in Europe people have just saved more cause they figure they will need more in retirement with such poor returns or parked the money in assets of various types creating bubbles.Earnings will be poor quite a while in the banking sector.  Eventually that will impact price whatever the long term view is.
