2017-06-05T15:18:00+10:00 : How about to adopt several radical rules in this country?

i)	All MPs will have their salaries’ growth tied to the growth of GDP of this country.

ii)	Their salaries will be paid in Aussie government long term bonds, so that if they are to fall into junks due to their mismanagement of this country’s economy these MPs will have a haircut too.

iii)	Their government pensions should be likewise restricted to government bonds only.

It‘s time to introduce some corporate spirit into our Parliament.  By binding their personal financial interest to the future prosperity of this country, we will be able to force them to be a little more enterprising and more accountable to the well being of this country.
