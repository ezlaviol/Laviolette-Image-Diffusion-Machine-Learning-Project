The wealthy use all the franking credits and pay some tax. The people who struggle lose a tax refund, yet he is a "labour" party leader? Increase the wealth gap???. Yes the Government are "saving" some money but they also lose a lot of people spending that money on things. Same can be said with Bill boy's CGT discount changes why bother investing when you pay tax on almost all the gains or his pompus negative gearing policy, do they not love the stamp duty they collect from investors, could you imagine how much the state governments over east in Mel and Sydney have got from Stamp duty in the last half decade. All of his policies have no drive for the current economy, he will be giving Australia the land down under a completely new meaning.
