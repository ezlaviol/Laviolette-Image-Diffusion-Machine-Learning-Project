Regarding nab, go on, you know you want to . If it doesn't go past 27.25 by sometime before October I will eat cake, but remember I like eating cake . (I know you wouldn't but I feel obliged to spell it out: don't buy nab, or anything else for that matter, because I say so). 

And no div cut for cba, not because I really have strong evidence for it, but because I like to be adversarial.
