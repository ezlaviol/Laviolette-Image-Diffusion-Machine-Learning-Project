In the end, more cash coming in for NAB and its shareholders. Not sure how much NAB made from it over the last 20 years and we have to remember that MLC was part of the problem covered by the royal commission. Part of NAB's strategy to rectify its position legally was to off-load it. Now that is done and the box is ticked.The good news is that they were able to off-load it. It probably could not come soon enough and at a better time.
