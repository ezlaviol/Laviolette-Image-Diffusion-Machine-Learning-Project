2023-08-24T13:15:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Australian inflation was the worst in three decades but the country was still unlikely to experience a recession, the head of the country's third-largest retail bank said on Thursday. 	"Inflation, while slowing, has hurt Australians more during the past 18 months than it has for three decades," National Australia Bank (NAB) CEO Ross McEwan said in a speech at the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce. 	"There is a lot of discussion as to whether Australia will head into a recession as we do have many headwinds. My view is we won't," McEwan added.
