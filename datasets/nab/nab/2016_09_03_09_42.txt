2016-09-03T09:42:00+10:00 : What's the odds given the soft jobs data, that offshore funds bid NAB up to $35 again as the thread headline suggests?

Think the brokers need to downramp it more coz my bet is offshore funds will eventually bid beat this up some come Monday.
SYD/MEL property safe for now with low rates in US and potential negative rates in Sydney/ Melbourne and Auckland good for it. In hindsight, perhaps they could have done CYB more gradually and only at the very end as the sector and capital stuff was always going to take a heap of time.
