Dangerous to compare European banks with Australia's banks as European banks are cot cases whereas Australian banks are still very resilient - and in a much better financial position.We should see a reduction in dividends but maybe only 10-20% - bearing in mind that in 12 months time, we should be seeing a full recovery in dividend yields so this is a longer term investment with a bump in the road.

Very likely dividends will be reduced and worse, this is from yesterday's AFR - Germany urges banks to hold off dividends and bonuses"............Germany's financial watchdog has urged banks to refrain from share buybacks and think twice before paying dividends and bonuses, the latest warning from regulators in Europe worried that banks could misuse funds meant to bolster the economy against the coronavirus."Australian banks may have to follow perhaps?
