2018-09-05T20:12:00+10:00 : It seems that Banks are out of favour with all.
Some politicians want to punish banks, with ridiculous extra taxes and reforms, which is really unfair.
Most or at least too many are applauding this move, but in the same time they don't realise, that while they are not shareholders as such. they are shareholders in their superfunds.  Lower SP hurts just about every Australian living soul.
And do not forget that the Shorten guy wants to get rid of the franking credit.
It's not easy to be a shareholder, basically risking your own wealth, and be kicked in the guts at every time they feel they can win a score.
