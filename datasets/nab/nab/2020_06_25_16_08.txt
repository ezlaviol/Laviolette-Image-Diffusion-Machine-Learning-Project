AusGov trying to time how to introduce this change, their primary goal being to avoid any pie-in-the-face problems.  Only purported obstacle to visitors coming, is them thinking the AusGov will drop its succesful policy that everyone coming needs spend two weeks in quarantine at their own cost.  IMHO great as will filter out short stayers,  enable those prepared remain longer than four weeks.Those considering coming, can see few alternatives to avoid COVID-19 infection areas, while Australia shows lower infections is looking a lot more attractive. Will be no shortage of those prepared for medium or longer holidays in Australia.With quarantine their starting point, their first two weeks relaxing in reasonable approved motel room, with meals, service, views with internet, makes quarantine hibernation an attractive promotion point. Encouraging such tourists to take longer holidays will be good for our economy,  while also more relaxing for those who do come.
