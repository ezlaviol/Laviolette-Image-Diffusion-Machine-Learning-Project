Everyone will say it's manipulation but there would be a lot more slightly nervous people still in good profit maybe taking a bit off the table. My thoughts anyway, like I said I have no idea why. CBA 80 will be some serious resistance. Don't forget it's not all about the dividend. If you have good green numbers up to div day then you make the decision to take and run or take and hold. I like to take and run personally if the sp is at a good high. I also like to be holding cash too . Just see at the results what the div is and where the sp will likely be at ex date. Usually the initial sell off is quite harsh but always a chance it recovers back to less than the result of the div sell off. A decision for you on the day. I'll be deciding on yr cake. I'd also like to be holding mostly cash around election time. Fortunately if I load up in nab, they go ex on the 4/11 and the election is on the 8/11 so not hard to be out of that one in time . BOQ might get a slight div cut as well. I'll be happy enough if it sits at 35c. Might not end up in anything but BOQ this run. Pretty deep in at the moment!
