They like mayhem, it makes them feel better about the upcoming Presidential Campaign, and sutures their telco/ electoral and banking (Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo) losses (much like Telstra and NewsCorp ill-fated unwatched unsubscribed for FoxTel JV which due to their losses may be unbankable).There might be a few unbankable things around. There might be a flight to blue chips and ASX 200 companies like NAB, ANZ, WBC, QAN, things that are still bankable.The Aussie economy needs a massive stimulus from Frydenberg and massive QE/ negative interest rates. 4 GDP per capita recessions in 23 years is pretty atrocious given all the immigration but this one impacted due to coronavirus could be a big one if the Government sits back and sleeps on it.
