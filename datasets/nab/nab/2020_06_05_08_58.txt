Prior to this happening, those on the upward swing need to sell - unless they happy to ride the downward cycle and see what probably will only be modest upwards movement thereafter.  IMO, I think there will be a slide as the market, based on real data, corrects.  This will reflect the actual value of the companies.  Then as the economy improves, you will see the usual trend of upwards and downwards dips in a market that is slowly moving upward (as the economy improves).
