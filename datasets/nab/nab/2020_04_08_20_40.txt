2020-04-08T20:40:00+10:00 : if they raise 20b @ 13$ then I donâ€™t think SP will ever cross 20$...bad news for those who are holding from 25$ to 29$...secondly if they have to raise then they should not stop Divis...divis are only 5.4b interm & final for one year...at-least let the gravy train keep running.
