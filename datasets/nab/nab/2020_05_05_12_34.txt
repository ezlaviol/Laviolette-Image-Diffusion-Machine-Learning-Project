Your 2 examples are only small over applications and yes if NAB only get $700m worth of applications I would expect they may well keep all. Same if only slightly over like MQG, would expect no scale back.
I gave the example of last SPP NAB did where $2,6b was applied for when chasing $750mIn the event of that type of excess highly likely there would be a scale back
I have no idea what level of applications NAB will receive in the current economic gloom, however I do expect it will be well supported and scale backs are a real chance!
It is just another part of the deal........................
