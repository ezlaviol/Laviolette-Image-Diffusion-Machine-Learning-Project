2016-08-03T09:24:00+10:00 : Why leave your money in the banks or in bonds? What do you get ? At best 1.5% ? Rather invest in the four big banks in the  #ASX. Expect 5% to 9% at current prices. Their SP have being massively hit since last year! Bargain. The negative attitude that the #ASX banks are doing badly is absurdly untrue.  They are well run and profitable companies. Suggest #BUY: NAB, ANZ, WBC, CBA
