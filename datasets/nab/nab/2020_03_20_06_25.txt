Short sellers provided liquidity to the market. The fact you can't amend your trading plan to take into account the larger volume of short selling is your problem and your problem alone. Being honest is not going to help you, and complaining to the government like a child whose pocket money was taken away isn't going to help either. Get your trading plan in better order, and stop complaining.
