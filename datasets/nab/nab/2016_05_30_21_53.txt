My thinking was that NAB has not had the run up most do post the ex-div drop. So with that in mind I was thinking/hoping post today it should oblige over the next one to two weeks and climb a dollar or more. Having said that, what you say is spot on, and Mr Market is often cruel and unpredictable.
Time will tell if I end up having "NAB regret" . Did not overcommit so even if I am wrong, it will not be a disaster.

Anyway, what else is one to do at the moment. At least it will provide some amusement.
