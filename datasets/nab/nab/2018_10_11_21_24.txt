2018-10-11T21:24:00+11:00 : We realistically needed this correction to happen. Are we really thinking a 3-4 day bloodbath though? I suppose the Feb correction ran about that long. I managed to pick up my first parcel of NAB shares in the mid 25s the day that Trump won the election and thought that was a complete steal (especially after they ran up to $31-32 in the next few months!) but I think your right it's looking like it will get that low again. One benefit the banks have is that there are enough people with similar objectives to us (happy to hold for income and buy the dips) that the SP at least partially gets propped up by the dividend yield (which is already getting ridiculously high)  so I can't see it getting much lower than $25.
