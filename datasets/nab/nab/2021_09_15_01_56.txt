2021-09-15T01:56:00+10:00 : FYI I'm not disgruntled?NAB looked after me very well. I was paid a six-figure salary and then given a nearly $100,000 redundancy package. I enjoyed lavish trips across the country on your dime.No complaints about the personal benefits I obtained about NAB. However, I could see from working in the bank why its share price is what it is and why NAB continues to fall behind CBA and Macquarie when it comes to innovating and serving customers.You may call things like excessive beer, free trips to the US for staff who had no business being there, and stolen laptops immaterial costs - I call it a lax management culture that has no idea and doesn't care about wasted funds. It's all in NAB's share price and highly volatile dividend.No need to attack me to defend your investment choices - maybe appreciate the insight I've provided you and go find a better stock to buy.
