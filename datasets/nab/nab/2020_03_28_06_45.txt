2020-03-28T06:45:00+11:00 : I agree with you.But the post and the graph that I quoted was from your post about 10 days before.Look at the post that I quoted and the graph, not the Title of the original post.   The graph in my quote of your post continues to March.And again I agree with your sentiment, and I was making the point that your views had changed over the last fortnight and therefore you weren't a bot posting to an agenda.
