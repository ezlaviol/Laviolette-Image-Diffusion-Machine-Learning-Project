NAB much like CBA appear hamstrung with the MLC (or in the case of CBA, CFS piece) so ANZ and WBC are probably the better plays in the sector apart from the regionals such as BEN and BOQ who should arguably now be able to gain traction.NABâ€™s result was poor. Understand your bit about NAB being sold off due to the WBC result earlier in the week.All things considered NAB held up well yesterday.Change my sentiment from sell to hold but not rushing out to buy just yet.
