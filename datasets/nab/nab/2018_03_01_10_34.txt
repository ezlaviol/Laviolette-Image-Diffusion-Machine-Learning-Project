Yeah it seems as though we have similar strategies, I do the same re Dow futures and I check on www.igmarkets.co.uk - what site do you use?

Ripper strategy with NWS - you nailed that one well done. Probably worth buying back in today depending on the dow futures if you like that company.

I bought HVN yesterday at $3.94 and sold this morning at $4.04 which I'm stoked with - made some good coin there so lucky lol.

Down 1% on TLS but would be happy to just make 1-2% so that's about $3.41'ish as a minimum and I know it'll bounce back so not worried there. DMP is killing me, hardly want to see it anymore and clearly now more of a medium/longer term hold. Still believe in the company and not afraid of my investment but it may now take weeks/months to get back especially after the wanker CEO selling etc. Cannot recommend it to anyone at the moment to be honest but all I know is when it turns (and it will), she'll run hard and fast.

Bought in to BEN this morning at $10.88 - my favourite trades are quality companies when they go ex-div such as this one. Would expect it to bounce back above $11+ in days as long as the wider the market doesn't get smashed or other bank stocks get smashed etc.

Have an order in for WPL at $28.55 - probably won't get there today but who knows as oil stocks were down 2% in the US overnight. Love this stock!

Yeh loving these chats mate - great work.
