Yes, there are troubling times, our banking RC, trade wars or the like, but you have to trade on fundamentals unless you are short term investing. 

NAB is currently yielding 7% fully franked, yes tax free!, so forget the excess franking credits that you might lose if you are low or nil net taxable income, like myself. The brute reality is you on get around 2% taxable income on cash. 

Buying NAB at these levels, p.s. I topped up yesterday at $28.45, makes longer term investing sense. Risks ahead I know but remember buy when fear is rising or at its peak and sell some when greed is rampant, and it will return.
