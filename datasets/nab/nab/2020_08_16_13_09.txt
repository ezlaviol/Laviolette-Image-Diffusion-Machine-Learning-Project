Has nothing to do with the ability of his peoples "underwriting" ability - some loans will always go bad -  if you are legitimately in the market, always have, always will!! 
Market conditions obviously dictate the level and provisioning required...........
Warning people about consequences of vanishing equity when in distress is sensible, although will fall on deaf ears.
Having to sell when the bell finally tolls and finding a depressed market is common and of course the scale of losses will then be blamed squarely on the banks!!
Of course many of these people were heading down this road well before recent events - Covid-19 is simply a catalyst.
(It is not aimed at all NAB customers)
Will be the same for many businesses and little doubt the banks will have to tread carefully when deciding to call in any debts.
The media and others with little financial understanding will always cry in anguish that all the customer needed was a bit more time and / or money(!!) when in reality often earlier hard decisions actually saves everyone from a worse outcome.
Ahh, human nature, nothing will change, but at least he was prepared to send out the warning.................
