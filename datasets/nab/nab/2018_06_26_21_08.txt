They are payments on NAB's 'Hybrid'/ 'Income Securities/Interest Rate Securities etc.,  some may have payments paid 1/4ly or 1/2 yearly . Usually the rate is a % above the BBSW, The Bank Bill Swap rate  for various periods - usually 90/180 days plus the %  margin.

This is a back of envelope explanation..... It's more complicated than that.

They are securities issued by NAB, that can be traded on the ASX. If you are interested have a look at the PDS for one of the Securities.. It sets out all the conditions... for that security.

I believe it's a way to raise funds.

That is my brief understanding.. I am sure others on this site can explain better than I .

Have a CBA  WBC  ANZ and other Banks they all have them, some with unusual names. I do remember CBA having   "PERLS"... 

Keep safe
