2015-09-08T21:53:00+10:00 : Big bounce in the banks today, anyone buying under $30.00 will feel vindicated... for today.

Short-medium term will likely be very volatile, stay patient with those buy targets and don't chase a rising stock in this market.

Patience is key - not attempting to cross-promote but my gaze drifted across to WPL today... Priced at an eight year low and current yield over 9% - I like them apples, and that's the sort of value that this market will be delivering from time to time.

Just my 2c.
