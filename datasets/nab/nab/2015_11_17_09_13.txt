2015-11-17T09:13:00+11:00 : Was in a NAB branch yesterday afternoon, when some baby-faced junior manager appeared instructing teller staff to remove any placards & posters with views of Paris and Eiffel Tower. WTF ?  Overheard him saying something about emailed instruction would be forwarded to staff shortly. What kind of Corporate HQ dickhead thought that was appropriate ? Would have thought leaving them up would have shown more solidarity with the French and Parisians than anything else. I guess there's no accounting for the thinking of corporate flunkys when comes to justifing their existence.
