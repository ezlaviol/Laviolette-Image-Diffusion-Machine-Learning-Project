paying particularly attention to the first half of it. Please don’t take this the wrong way, if that is possible, but I have great fears for the safety of your capital given some of your posts. 

Regarding AZJ. The banks and their minions constantly play with other stocks. All those millions  need to be working constantly. It’s not like they can put it in their accounts for interest. They will buy and sell whatever takes their fancy at the time to make some return on any capital they have idle, while waiting for it to be deployed. And because the banks are big, they can influence the SP of their targets, to their advantage of course. In this case there was some shorting involved as well. Nice work if you can get it. Short the stock you are accumulating to make money and get a better entry point. It’s good to be the king hey. God bless NAB .
