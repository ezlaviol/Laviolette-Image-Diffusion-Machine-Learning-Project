I'm not sure how long the Chinese economy can sustain, given current US China relationship deteriorates very quickly, and CCP becomes more and more hostile to the world. IF the Chinese economy falls into abys and there's no replacement for the demands of Australian resources, you can count on oz economy to have significant impact. NAB has higher exposure to business loans most likely will get biggest hit. However Never Say Never though.
