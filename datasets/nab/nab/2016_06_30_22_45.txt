2016-06-30T22:45:00+10:00 : Sounds optimistic unless we have a great springboard into to the div period. If we are sitting around $28 by the 27th Oct and don't get a div cut close to $30? Talk of a RBA rate cut in August (are they still talking about that?) might send more money into banks for a half decent return if it happens, a coalition win (obviously) this weekend and EU stability. I think the CBA full results on the 10th August will set the mood for what the other results might bring. All eyes on them. If they cut their div then even though it seemed a positive for ANZ I think it will be taken as a negative from the big boy on the block. Just what I think ofc. If cba comes out with a good result I'll be filling my pockets with nab with 2 months before the results if I haven't bought before then. Even with a div cut its still the best value imo. I'll probably be filling them anyway. Still annoyed I didn't get those $24 buys. I was positive Brexit was going to last more than 2 days . I thought it was going to be the next oil at $25 world crisis. Plenty of time for another over reaction to something going on but on positive news who knows. Might head on back to 27 or higher if sentiment keeps tracking the positive. Ifs, buts and maybes. I think sentiment of Trump losing the election would also be a positive. Ex div on the 4th, election on the 8th and numbers at this stage have Hilary leading by double digits last I heard. That would be good for stability even if it's not a kick up the bum for US politicians. If it does hit $30 or higher I will have cake and toast the good fortune of holders and your $30 call success which at that price hopefully I've bought a bunch of them way beforehand.

Submitting my call now. Somewhere between $18-$33 for the rest of the year
