even with a div drop you still want find yields this good so investors need to be mindful that if they sit their cash on the sidelines getting a pathetic 2% in the bank they run the risk of the sp rising and then their yield being less if they buy at a higher price.

yes there is a chance that they buy now and the sp drops a dollar or two with all the media noise going on at the moment, well who cares the stock will still return a substantial yield that will be hard to find anywhere else.

remember its impossible to pick the bottoms, I feel nab is pretty damn close to the bottom at the moment.

raising capital is not something to worry about at the moment and probably want even start to come into play until after the dividend in November.

brexit, what a laugh this is, this rubbish will be in and out of the media for the next 2-3 years, does that mean you just sit your money in cash at 2% for all that time for safety, no way that's madness, I mean really how is brfexit at the minute going to effect aussie banks, they don't even know what brexit will do and how it will effect things.

royal commission, well again pretty certain libs get in and that's another negative that gets deleted.

so in summary wash out all the noise and don't underestimate the yield NAB is offering.

it wouldn't surprise me if we see some green shoots from nab today....fingers crossed

buy when it feels wrong, not when there has been a big rally, for example lately everyone is jumping into resources, well I feel the banks have been punished enough over the last few days that its a good buying opportunity.
