People on this thread suggesting that you can't predict the market... true to an extent but its been pretty easy with NAB - has been a complete dud in a strong market, failing to get over the $30 line which is a mediocre price target regardless.

Now we get to see how she performs when the Dow drops 666 points in a session, and it's not hard to predict what she does next. If the rot sets in on the DJIA $26 is the next target.
