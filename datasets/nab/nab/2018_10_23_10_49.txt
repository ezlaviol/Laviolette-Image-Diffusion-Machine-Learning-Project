My guess is that the dividend will be down by 10-15% and it will not be going up again anytime soon. The Banks have had a great run but itâ€™s finished. All this aside they are good businesses so it comes down to what you reckon fair value is, and that is difficult. I bought a few NAB at 25.55 average recently. There is some technical support at about $24, and I believe NAB May indeed fall to around there post dividend.
