2015-05-25T11:19:00+10:00 : bad management seems to be rampant at the moment,even in bluechips. i am a holder of WOW,and the management is coming under fire from all angles.
what i was led to believe was that the board had a major influence on a management shakeup if they were under performing,so i suppose we should all be blaming the system of board selection and trying to change an old instilled bugbear-"the old boy"s club".
