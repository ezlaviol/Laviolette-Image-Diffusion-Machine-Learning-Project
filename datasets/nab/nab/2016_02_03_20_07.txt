2016-02-03T20:07:00+11:00 : OK... I've been patient with NAB and I'm not going to exit my position completely because once they get the cash from the current de-merger (around $2 billion?) they may be going forward with an improved strategy... I'm hoping for better future performance but I'm not prepared to throw any more money at a NAB investment which continues to under-deliver.

Today I saw once again NAB is punished on a bad day to the tune of around 5.5% whilst CBA is down less than 3%. I consistently see CBA move upwards more on the good days and down less on bad days.

Just compare the charts and you will see how awful NAB has been compared CBA over pretty much any time period you care to use but in summary (not including divvy):

Over 1 yr CBA is about 10% better.
Over 3 yrs, CBA is about 20% better.
Over 5 yrs CBA is about 30% better.
Over 10 yrs CBA is about 100% better.

So... I'm taking the de-merger cash and increasing my CBA holdings (I'm overweight into NAB by comparison) and I can't see myself buying any more NAB but will hold my existing position and run with the DRP shares I build over time.

Anyway... Venting mainly but just sharing my 2c worth.
