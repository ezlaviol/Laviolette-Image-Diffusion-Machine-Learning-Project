Still as I said the problems regarding red tape at a state and local government level are far bigger challenges that need to be resolved that will open up the supply side and this is where I'd focus energy on. Plenty of in fill developments that are scuttled by councils pandering to local interest groups rather than providing sustainable multi-story developments etc that would enable population growth closer to the city. If managed properly you'd set aside say 20% of the development for essential services workers to rent nearby to their work to build sustainable affordable housing for all demographics.
