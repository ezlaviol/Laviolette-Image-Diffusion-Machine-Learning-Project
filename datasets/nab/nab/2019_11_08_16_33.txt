The latest report though shows that 8.6% was the actual trading loss and the rest of the loss was for the provisions set aside as the result of the RC and the software upgrade which were not present last year. I think interest rates are also going to be maybe 1% less moving forward.NAB will prevail but maybe not much gain in the SP for another 12-18 months.

Same period last year, NAB SP is up at least 15% ie: $25 and this was at the height of the Financial RC review.
