2016-02-11T12:43:00+11:00 : Moving on, let's discuss charts and compare their historical performance. 
Using the ASX charting tool. (I haven't used it in a while, I was impressed!)

Last chart. Comparing all 4 from Jan 2013 onwards. (i had written a much longer post over a longer timeline)
NAB is doing better relatively to all of the others early on! It's really whooping CBA's butt all the way to May 2014, climbing higher and faster. Over the whole period from Jan 09 until today... CBA 28.18%, WBC 18.33%, NAB 14.80% and ANZ -1.21%.

Maybe comparing NAB and WBC is better.
ANZ really dropped away only recently.
