2019-02-23T14:56:00+11:00 : Thanks..Point is NAB has gone from being Biggest Bank of Australia to Smallest Bank (Among Four) while CEO / Executives have taken Billions in Bonus and Salaries...The ex CEO who could not care less about his own staff being involved in frauds, still manages around 20 Million Dollar Worth Bonus, this is how absurd the CEO / Executive Pay Package can get. ..Friend of mine sits at top level of large Australian Corporation. He often tells the truth that Executives Dont Buy Shares in their own Company (he do get bucket load of freebies as other do), they only loves Freebies (Bonus Shares). That is harsh reality of Corporate World
