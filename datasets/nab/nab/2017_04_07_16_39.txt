I generally support the regulation of the banking industry. Certainly upgrading their capital requirements in the current climate seems prudent, its fair to swap short term profits to insure against needing a bail out should the coming house price correction be on the scale of what occurred in say the US or Ireland 10 years ago.

So the regulator creates value for us here by enabling them act in unison.
