2020-04-05T11:30:00+10:00 : I tend to agree with most of that. Bearing in mind of course that most of the places you mention are drawing on working from home and social distancing measures and I guess farmers tend to work alone anyway.Areas where there are issues would include shopping (particularly markets) and public transport. I travel using public transport but will say that only around half a dozen people in a bus is probably lower risk and when I have gone into a bank there are few people there. In any case I will more than likely be permanently working from home after Easter.We may well have our lives disrupted over the next six months but I think there are signs that the virus is slowing to some extent and maybe by the end of June we could even see some relaxation of the current measures.Be interesting to see the stats to see how many people get the virus from shopping or using public transport. Though I would say that the biggest risk comes from childcare facilities where social distancing is not controllable and larger numbers are congregating together from a more varied group in the community.I am one of those who says we have gone too far with shutdowns. Maybe a bit overdone -  but could be wrong I suppose.

This BS about the entire country being shut down is just that total "BS".Examples of not being shut down:-How do we eat every day?Buy food from companies that can supply us food. WOW, Coles , Aldi, IGA etc....(smaller markets)Who supplies this food to these companies?Who supplies the tooth paste, toilet paper?All of these companies are operating and employing a tonne of people.Building industry:-I know people in this industry and it is full steam ahead with many building projects not delayed and are working 5-6 days a week.Advertising industry.Banks.Insurance.Fund managers.Local councils.Hardware stores (Bunnings)Plumbing supplies.The various trades - carpenters, plumbers and electrians all still working.Golf Courses still open with management teams, pro shop managers and course green keepers.Takeway food/Coffees etc (McDonalds etc)These business are raking in the bucks.Petrol stations / Car mechanics.Bus / Train driversFarmers working 24/7 growing crops after the recent rain.Childcare facilities open for business with Govt assistance.I could could go on and on listing the business still operating.On another issue with banks delaying repayments to loans and landlords delaying rent payments, business's will not go into Administration, they will start up again and re-employee most people after COVID-19 has past,The various Govt welfare packages paying the people who have lost their jobs  and paying employers to keep people in jobs , will allow the economic engine of the country to keep running so when this is all over the Australian economy will get back to the normal fairly quickly.IMO: Bank shares are a grest BUY right now and hold for 12-24 months and you will be rewarded.
