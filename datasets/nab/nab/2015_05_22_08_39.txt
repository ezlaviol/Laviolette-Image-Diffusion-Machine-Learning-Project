that then turned you into a hopeless alcoholic,with nothing but revenge on your mind(a very dangerous combination), with understandable constant rantings about "debt is evil"
also,that's why you probably fantasize as being a successful shorter-it gives you a psychological "high" if you   see graphical "lows".
so what"s to come of you and your future and the long road back to normality-go to CashConverters and get a no questions asked loan and have another go at that business venture,and don"t forget the $20K tax deduction.
