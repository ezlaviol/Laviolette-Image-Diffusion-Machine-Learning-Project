2021-02-22T20:38:00+11:00 : Nab is still undervalued. before Covid it was $28-29. I've been buying and selling nab with high and lows. $24.50 will be lucky to get now. it'll go up to 25.50 soon as it did prior.if you do DD and look at charts, you'll se what I mean. Dividends should be back to near normal as well. I'm guessing at the 80c stage, if not 99c. that's on next month.I've moved on to riskier stocks like MXC. (mcg Pharma) that's listed on London forex as well.
