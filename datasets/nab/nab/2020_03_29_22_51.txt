The lack of confidence in private property rights in Australia will never come back. And that is absolutely horrendous long term for all the banks but especially NAB IMHO but pls DYODD.Australia has become a socialist country as international return travellers are put up at 5 star hotels at taxpayer's expense while landlords are told by the Government to go to the wolves and lose most if not all of their investment capital and income. The LNP got trounced coming third to One Nation and the ALP in Queensland by-elections so capitalism in Australia is effectively dead at the moment.Cannot see much hope for NAB unless the LNP gets confidence back in the private property market by subsidising the full rental arrears of the landlord. Scott Morrison is not only destroying the LNP, he is destroying Australian private property rights, property values of all Australian properties, landlords, Australian capitalism and all Australian banks including NAB.More death due to the Wuhan virus although this time it was Australian created IMHO but pls DYOR regardless of Ai Fen, the January decisions in Wuhan and Beijing.
