The others that just got converted as "per terms" given shares at 21.34!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

instant loss on paper when equity is selling for  13.88!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

brutal

I guess alot more of these types of products will be converted to sure up bank balance sheets as they postpone repayments on all sorts of things.

Just had to look at the conversion price again.  wow

This is where investors discover high interest secure bank products comes with high risk.  I personally thought they would start converting but closer to the equity price.

good luck
