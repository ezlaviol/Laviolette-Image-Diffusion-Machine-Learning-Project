2018-11-16T14:58:00+11:00 : Next dividend announcement a bit of a way off, 2 May 2019. Will be a long time now between dividend payments (given the stock is now Ex dividend), if you buy today- next payment of dividend is 3 July 2019. Lot of people take the money off the table for the almost 8 month dividend drought.Still think is a buy, at these prices. Stock is being rotated out, and out of favour post RC. These are massive profit making machines that, if required, can aggressively cut costs- go online (a la U Bank- owned by NAB), reduce services, close retail facilities and pushÂ interest rates up "out of cycle".Governments might whinge, but a strong banking system its in everyone's interest. Even Labor defended them aggressively in the GFC.
