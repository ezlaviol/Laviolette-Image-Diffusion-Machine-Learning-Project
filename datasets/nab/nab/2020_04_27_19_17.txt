Top heavy, highly inefficient, parasites that only retain their SP because they (used to) provide big divvis for super funds and SFR's.Those days are over..The next 6 months are going to be fascinating to watch.Yes, they are probably too big to fail, but that doesn't mean their SP can't tank just like Deutsche bank.It's a new paradigm. The banks and their shareholders just haven't realised yet - IMHO.
