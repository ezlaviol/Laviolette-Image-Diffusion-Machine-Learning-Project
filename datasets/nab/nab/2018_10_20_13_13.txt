One reason is that the default rates are low as home owners will do almost anything to pay their mortgage. However, if something does go pear shaped the concentration of bank assets in home loans would become a serious millstone. Suppose house prices fall by 20%. Why would that happen? Interest rates could rise substantially so that ‘borderline’ borrowers just cannot afford their repayments. Add to this group those who borrowed using 3 to 5 year interest only loans at very loan rates. As these loans mature they will (largely) have to replace these loans with much higher repayment P+I loans. Significant numbers of these borrowers will have to sell..this is an important issue. Suppose China or somewhere else important to Australia has a problem: Australian unemployment could quickly escalate: the unemployed cannot afford mortgages. Of course none of this may happen, however there is a great complacency in Australia, which imo is unjustified.
