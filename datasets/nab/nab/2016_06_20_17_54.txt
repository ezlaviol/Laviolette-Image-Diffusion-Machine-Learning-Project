2016-06-20T17:54:00+10:00 : Already sold with profit today @25.75. Might be an early call but profits are money in the bank. I wish all NAB holders a great day tomorrow. Sold my BEN as well. Sad about that. Saw what looked like some covering today and although my Last buy was 9.07 I still think it has more to run. God bless you Aussie bank holders. Salt of the earth. Hopefully it all crashes and burns in the next week so I can buy cheap shares! I'm not holding my breath
