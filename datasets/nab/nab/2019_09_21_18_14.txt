2019-09-21T18:14:00+10:00 : JCoure - did the article go into much detail on NAB/MLC potential liability? The RC opened up the door abit to possibly litigation though it does not appear to have had any impact on bank SP growth over the last three months - perhaps the impact of litigation is small enough to be immaterial. Maybe even a bit premature to make the "sell" call at this stage. Thoughts?

the Australian newspaper has run an article called “Tragedy of ‘Weary’ Dunlop’s son” highly critical of NAB, Advantage, Perpetual, MLC, Geoff Lloyd, Andrew Thorburn and Phil Chronican. Article Suggests a lot of complaints and legal actions to come regarding responsible lending.change my sentiment from hold to sell.
