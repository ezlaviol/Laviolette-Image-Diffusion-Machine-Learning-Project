The country's No. 2 lender reported a cash profit of A$8.06  billion ($6.17 billion) for the year ended Sept. 30, from A$7.82  billion a year ago. That missed the 4 percent increase in cash  profit expected by 7 analysts polled by Reuters.  	Westpac announced a final dividend of A$0.94 per share, same  as last year.
