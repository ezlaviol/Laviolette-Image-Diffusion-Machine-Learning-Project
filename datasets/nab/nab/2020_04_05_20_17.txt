2020-04-05T20:17:00+10:00 : I suspect many formerly viable businesses simply won't be be there is six months, so job keeper may as well just be a job seeker (essentially it is anyway, as one is paid pre taxed and one is paid post taxed- making it seem higher) however one risk here is job keeper may eventually end in a longer term situation than the government expects as once they realise the economics of slamming brakes on small and medium business is more likely to result in many permanent shut downs and bankruptcy on mass scale.While there is some merit at extreme cost to everyone, It seems like the government has based its decisions on the "experts" with sort of risk benefit analysis and chosen the worst possible case scenario. I guess they had to draw a line in the sand somewhere. Everyone of course has an opinion - mine is shutting down the economy at the speed of hitting a brick wall may result in it not being so easy to start again, especially given the fact that nobody really knows how long this thing will or won't last. Yet a good proportion of the entire countries viability may as well have been gambled on essentially a two up game. I'm am however pretty sure the IMF is happy with this outcome as I presume they would get interest on this?  Still I can definitely also see others have different opinions looking at Logtime 's brain dead contribution with nothing useful to add I can't help but wonder what the W stands for but I'm guessing it probably involves shower time.
