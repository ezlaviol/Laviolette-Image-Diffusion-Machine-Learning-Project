t scary at all. What we are seeing is relief from not having a Labour goverment that would have dampened capitalism and growth in this country. Stock in particular financial are simply being adjusted to rightful valuations. Wise to buy the dips from here. I see the All Ordinaries reaching all time new highs of 7000+ in the next 12 months. Great buying opportunity
