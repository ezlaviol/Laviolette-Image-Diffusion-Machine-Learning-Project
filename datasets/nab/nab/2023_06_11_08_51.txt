There should be a root and branch removal of PWC and ex PWC people from NAB especially after the scandals of years gone past like the NAB FX scandal.Having any contracts with PWC is not a good look and NAB should remove all people of PWC and formerly of PWC from its operation unless it wants to go back to the trash can IMHO.
