They will settle this outside court and get a fine a lot less more likely C.1b or a slap on the wrist   NAB may decide to drag this in then courts for years to come to try avoid or lower settlement fee.   I’m more concerned with AUSTRAC currently investigating NAB for money laundering.  Not sure I would be buying NAB unless you’re willing to take on significant  risk that the SP won’t grow or go backwards!
