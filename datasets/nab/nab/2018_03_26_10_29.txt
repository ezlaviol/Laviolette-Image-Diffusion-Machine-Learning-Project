2018-03-26T10:29:00+11:00 : New week, new leg down for the banks. Trump has dished up one if the inevitable Black Swan events via "trade wars" and we see NAB $28.50 pre-divvy. Ouch.

No surprise to see CBA below $72 this morning, I wouldn't be touching any of them with a ten foot pole at this stage.

Just wait until some findings start rolling in from the royal commission and CBA cop some fines.
