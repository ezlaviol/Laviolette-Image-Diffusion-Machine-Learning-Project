Since 48% of NAB is owned by retail investors the SPP should be about the same size as the placement. i.e. $3B not $500M. I think retail investors have the right to be pretty angry if we get less than instos on a proportional basis. If this does happen it would be worth following up with APRA as there is a clear situation where one category of holder is favoured over the other.
