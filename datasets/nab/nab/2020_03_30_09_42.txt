2020-03-30T09:42:00+11:00 : Australia’s approach is effectively to treat the economy like a Soviet would have IMHO. If you suspend a landlord’s right to kick out a tenant, that is effectively socialist. If you suspend capitalism in the face of a pandemic when no one is doing the same, such as six month moratorium for tenants paying rent, that economy is not going to come back for a while IMHO.Australia will now significantly lag other countries in getting out of their economic crisis IMHO. I do not think Australian property will be worth much on the other side. Fatalities and caseload are projected to be heaviest in Australia in the Southern Hemisphere in July and August due to the incidence of the Wuhan virus during winter months.NAB badly managed by Andrew Thorburn and Ross McEwen, with insufficient employees for a crisis, ASIC issues, Court cases and compliance issues, has to be somehow make it to August. They are possibly the weakest of the Big 4 but do not have the enormous residential property portfolio that will so devastate the carrying values and portfolio of CBA but that is about the best you could say for them.IMHO NAB and CBA are most at risk from this Australian Economic debacle based on their past performance and portfolios.
