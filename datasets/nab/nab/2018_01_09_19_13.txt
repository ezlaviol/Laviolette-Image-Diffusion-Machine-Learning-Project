2018-01-09T19:13:00+11:00 : I exited some capital from NAB today (luckily towards the daily high) for no specific reason other than the fact that I have 2-3 lighter weight tigers in my portfolio that are just beginning to roar, and a chunk of capital sitting in this sleepy, overweight house cat.

I'll bet my left nut that the capital grows a truckload faster elsewhere and this was the basis for restructuring. 

Still holding, not sure if I'll be staying.
