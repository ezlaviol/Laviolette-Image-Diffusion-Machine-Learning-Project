2020-01-20T16:14:00+11:00 : NAB picked a day to appoint Simon McKeon to the Board, the day RIO received adverse legal judgement upon which Simon McKeon now sits or sat losing comprehensively in the dock and on appeal. The Takeovers Panel ruled against for Corporations Act disclosure, governance, risk and compliance failings, see the text from the judgement below.The financial regulators might now seize the day with NAB given Simon McKeon's previous Board failings.Perhaps they will need to rescind the appointment or did they have advance notice of the Takeover Panel's decision against RIO TINTO in the ERA decision? It does not make the NAB Board to have looked very good in not realizing the reputational risk of the decision to appoint McKeon.The RIO Board appears to have failed governance, risk and compliance massively. With all NAB's problems out of the Royal Commission, did they not want untarnished people appointed to the Board or go back to the same sort of people that had them in the Royal Commission in the first place?Text of the judgement below, not happy reading for RIO sholders and now NAB sholders, given the Board's already tarnished reputation.Change my sentiment from hold to sell. Mr Ewen and his NAB Board seems very bad at due diligence IMHO.Energy Resources of Australia Limited 02R – Review Panel DecisionThe review Panel has affirmed the decision of the initial Panel to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances in Energy Resources of Australia Limited (Annexure A) and varied the initial Panel’s orders (Annexure B). The review Panel was satisfied that orders prohibiting Rio Tinto1 from compulsorily acquiring shares in Energy Resources of Australia Limited (ERA) as a consequence of ERA’s entitlement offer would be unfairly prejudicial to Rio Tinto and therefore removed those orders. The review Panel considered it was appropriate to require Rio Tinto to formintentions regarding compulsory acquisition in the event that Rio Tinto becomes a 90% holder in ERA’s ordinary shares (as a result of the entitlement offer and underwriting agreement) and for ERA to provide further disclosure of Rio Tinto’s intentions to its shareholders. The review Panel also considered it was appropriate to further extend the entitlement offer timetable by 15 business days for ERA shareholders to consider the additional disclosure. The sitting Panel was Jeremy Leibler, Bruce McLennan and Karen Phin (sitting President).The Panel will publish its reasons for the decision in due course on its website www.takeovers.gov.au.
