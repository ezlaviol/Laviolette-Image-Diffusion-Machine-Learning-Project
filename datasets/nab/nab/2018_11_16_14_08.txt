2018-11-16T14:08:00+11:00 : I’m taking the current period of DRP calculations into a higher consideration than any other news.

WBC starting Nov 19-30
ANZ  Nov 16-29

Interesting periods to watch prices.

NAB running Nov 13-21 + 1.5% discount.

Low prices are more shares in the hands of funds.

That’s my conspiracy theory
