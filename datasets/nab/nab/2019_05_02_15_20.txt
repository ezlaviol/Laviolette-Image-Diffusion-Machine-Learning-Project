I wonder how much they expect the Royal Commission to cost them, and have they provisioned the lot in this one divi, so that it's back to business as usual in six months' time.My opinion of the Bank's overly restrictive lending criteria is that it's a collective statement of . . . 'you want to kick us for irresponsibly lending money, we'll show you what happens to the housing market & economy when we don't lend money".   At some stage the Govt will be asking the Bank's to please loosen up and lend more.And as the half yearly results show, it's not greatly effecting the cash earnings of the Banks; they're still charging interest on the Billions already lent, it's just having a short term impact on new loan interest & fees, but that'll all be made up for when they take the brakes off.Personally, I'm not super happy with the reduced divi, but I don't think it's a structural change.
