2020-06-05T14:03:00+10:00 : I disagree, I have only 500 shares prior to the SPP, applied for 10k’s worth and got 176.Not complaining about it, but I think NAB were fairly short sighted thinking there wouldn’t be a stampede for shares, and IMO, they should have announced a scale so I (and plenty of others) didn’t have cash tied up for no apparent reason.I don’t understand your last statement, if you don’t have cash you don’t have cash.. I cant see how you can blame anyone for that.
