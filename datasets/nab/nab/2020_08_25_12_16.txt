For borrowers with lower LVR's who might get into trouble, the Banks won't generally be at risk of losing money, because they have an asset to sell and recover their funds . . . so, that's the difference between not paying now or not paying later. I think NAB actually broke up the mix of deferred loans by LVR in their latest report, so it's easy to see that they are not at great risk and the fact that they reduced their provisioning confirms this.On the upside, one of the biggest challenges for banks is to lend money out faster than it gets repaid.  So putting repayments on deferral is actually good for the banks, provided they do eventually get paid.  What I mean is if they have a good customer who is going to eventually pay them back, they are better off if the customer takes as much time as possible to do so.I am quite confident that the banks will recover quickly once Covid is under control.  Just not sure when that's going to be . . Flip
