What difference does it make if you lock in a loss on NAB but then buy a beaten-down CBA in the short-term?I mean, you keep saying responding to me is a waste of time but then create fairytales that NAB will recover without even trying to half-bake a thesis around why. My question is: why? NAB won't just go to $30 because it's NAB and yeah you know because it'll just magically happen. And now that you mention business lending... that's probably even less of a reason to own it given how many SMEs won't make it through this crisis and if they do, they'll be trading in a severely weakened economy. As a result, NAB will have higher NPAs - but that wouldn't have mattered to me if NAB management showed shareholders over past cycles that they were good managers of risk and capital. Instead, they paid out all their money as dividends (and then some) only to ask for it back cap in hand.
