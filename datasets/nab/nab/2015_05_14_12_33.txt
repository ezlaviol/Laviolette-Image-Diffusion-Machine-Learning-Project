2015-05-14T12:33:00+10:00 : I have done very well out of NAB over the years and at times they have made some lousy decisions but not as bad as BHP .
I think that
on the information that I have NAB will be closer to $40 by the end of the year than $20.

Just keep on shorting them but I know where you will end up.
