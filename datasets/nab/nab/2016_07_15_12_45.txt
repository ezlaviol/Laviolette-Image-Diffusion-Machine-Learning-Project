Told ya. My bad habit is selling too early. I knew cba would would be first to pop for the div cycle. Didn't buy, ahh well. Still many months for nab etc. May or may not get a retrace. BoE looking at easing next month, that will have a positive effect. Sad I sold my BEN too obviously. That was always going to cover. Cmon Boq!
