2015-10-30T17:22:00+11:00 : Closed near the daily low although not quite on it - could go either way but that divvy looming on Thurs must entice buyers sooner or later. 

I was in line below $30 to buy today but couldn't see it happening, came up a little just because I think it was time to buy a few.

I personally think a rate cut on Tuesday is a 90% chance of happening & don't see the RBA having any options since the big four already raised their rates by 0.2% and inflation figures are so low...
