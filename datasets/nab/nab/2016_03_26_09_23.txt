But the op has moved from incoherent sentences "At this uncharted history in time", to metaphors of hurricanes and a heroine (female hero) wearing off. I love a good doomsayer. Especially one that has trouble putting meaningful sentences together.

I think he/she is missing that a lot of people like myself want nothing more than nab sp to tank. I just wish he/she could do it without looking like a fool. It just makes threads like these into a comedy show rather than a serious attempt at convincing several people to sell a few thousand shares.
