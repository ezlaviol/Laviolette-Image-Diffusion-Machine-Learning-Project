2020-05-11T12:45:00+10:00 : you would have to have rocks in your head to a. sell at these levelsb. not participate in SPP (if you have the funds)the economy will pick up again, NAB will be a clear winner in a year's time, it was actually doing very well before the virus hit, it would probably be above 30 bucks if this crisis didn't happen, any stock you buy has a risk/reward ratio, imo this stock has much higher reward than risk
