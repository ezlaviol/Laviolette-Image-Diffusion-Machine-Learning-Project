2019-11-02T09:43:00+11:00 : Low rates won't help and the property market is a bit volatile but basically subdued - maybe Sydney and Melbourne will buck the trend.Ex div date is a not that far off and it will be interesting to see if the SP falls and stays below the dividend value - might give a general pointer to where the sector is going.Good to see that the US has had positive news with jobs and has pushed the DOW up 300 points. Will this push the ASX (and banks) up on Monday? We've had a couple of good days on the DOW over the last week and banks shares have fallen anyway - that is not normally the case.Though MissG, there have been several of these predictions of "high tide" for the banks. None have eventuated so far. Maybe different circumstances now, of course, but I think we need to take them with a decent pinch of salt. This prediction might hit the mark - or maybe it will be the same as the predictions of the banks demise in the past.
