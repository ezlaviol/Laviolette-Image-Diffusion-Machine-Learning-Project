2018-12-05T11:06:00+11:00 : Ken Henry is the problem with his Socialist replies at the RC. Remember Henry was Rudds advisor during the GFC and he urged Rudd to spend the Future's Fund and urged Rudd that the banking system needed to be stated controlled and he said at the RC that the Government should control the Banks. 
We need to dump Henry.
