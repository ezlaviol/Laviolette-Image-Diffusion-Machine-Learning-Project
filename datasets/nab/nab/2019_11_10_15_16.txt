hi footmaxi am looking for NAB to spinoff MLC to get the best value for shareholders, MLC wealth business would be able to operate with more focus as a separate entity. The update from the report is the separation is progressing but they are making sure the stand alone entity is sustainable when it splits is my reading, so they need to fix the RC issues prior to split, also the payouts to clients is best resolved prior to split so the bigger bank can absorb  .There is NOT much growth in Banks, once they have resolved the RC issues and completed the strategy to reposition for lower cost of operation for the digital future, bank will go back to high payout ratio so may see 10% returns again which i would be reasonably happy with . Gross dividend payout with all these issues is about 8% so pretty reasonable compared to Cash return.My current thinking is if it goes to 31 sell , under 27 buy,  hold in between for the 8% return.d.
