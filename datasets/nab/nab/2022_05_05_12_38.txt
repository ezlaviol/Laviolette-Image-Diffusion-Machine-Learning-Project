2022-05-05T12:38:00+10:00 : it was only gift for insto and fund managers, as i said in my original comment those long-term holders of banks are retiree who normally bought the stock for dividend income not one off capital gain so yes, I did bought in CR but never sold as investment in bank is not trading but for long-term dividend income for me personally.insto & fund manager on the otherside invest to trade not to keep it with them for life so they are the biggest beneficiary to gift while retail holders who are long-term holders got their value diluted and then buy-back further wasted fund so it was significantly poor gift for retail holders... ! without capital raise and buy-back NAB would have better NTA at the moment similar to or better then ANZ while we are $3 less then ANZ at the moment in absolute term in my opinion.
