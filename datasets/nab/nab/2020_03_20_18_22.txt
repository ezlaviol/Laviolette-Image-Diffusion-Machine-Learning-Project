I think some are confused on some of this.
As I said earlier, loan repayments are not income for the banks!!
The Banks account for the interest and fees charged to the loans as income and they certainly have not said they are going to stop charging interest and fees. It is purely for cash flow assistance to borrowers at this stage.
