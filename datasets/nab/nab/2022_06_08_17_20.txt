NIM's aside, banks do not always do well during hawkish monetary policy period, and our banking sector is far too protected to look outside the box.  Actually we should be concerned about the broader market, looking very toppy and wobbly, would not take much for some sizable legs down. Two years of the good times no fundamental basis for such, and perhaps now a prolonged market period with a downward trajectory.  Many will disagree no doubt but when the banking sector turns down, watch out below.  Good thread so far, some wise thinking there.
