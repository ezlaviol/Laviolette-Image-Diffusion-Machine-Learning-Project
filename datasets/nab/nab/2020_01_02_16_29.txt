2020-01-02T16:29:00+11:00 : nobody can predict high ,lows or anything in between. 12month low 23.47- 12month high 30.  @current market price earning 6.7% or $1.65 full franked. considering current interest rates in a bank account about 2% to earn $1.65 you would need $82.50 to earn the same money yet still have to pay tax. so in relation to current interest rates it's very cheap. second with an nta/ book value of $19.30 also makes it look cheap. disclaimer i don't currently own NAB shares, am committed elsewhere.
