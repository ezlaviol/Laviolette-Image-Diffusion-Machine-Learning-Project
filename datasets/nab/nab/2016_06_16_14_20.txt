There is talk that the brexit is driving the negative sentiment towards the sector, but from my understanding it should not directly effect NAB because they sold off their UK interests recently.

Other than brexit, fears of increasing bad loans due to residential property risk, and the impacts of a possible royal commission into the banking sector (and other investigations) are things i wonder about.
