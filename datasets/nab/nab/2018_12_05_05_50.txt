2018-12-05T05:50:00+11:00 : All US indices down 3% plus right now (delayed by 20 min or so...). Today is probably going to be a sell off across all sectors, banks included. Another test of lows is on the cards? 
The only saving grace is that our listed companies are not trading at PEs as high as US except for a few growth stocks but in saying that our economy is not doing as well as the US either.
Any thoughts on why the massive sell off in US markets today? i.e. other than markets do not believe the US/China trade talks are not going to lead to any resolution?
