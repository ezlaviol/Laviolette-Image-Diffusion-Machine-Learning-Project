And I'm not in ANZ atm.Look fair point, there may be some damage, but I'm not seeing it as warranting the blood bath the SPs have taken. I understand a fair bit of that is because of the impact of zero interest rates and their spread, but personally I think the fear is a bit overdone. Particularly as the property market has turned.I guess we'll see in a year or two
