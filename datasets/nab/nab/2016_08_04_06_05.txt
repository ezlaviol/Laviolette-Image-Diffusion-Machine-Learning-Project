Yes they have high yield but that needs to be considered in light of their large leverage. You can't compare their yield directly to a conservatively financed industrial company.
I bought the banks during the GFC and sold a little later. If honest I would have to say I didn't understand the balance sheet and financial statements - I think only a few experts do.
As I only buy what I know, best to leave well enough alone is my perspective. I won't take silly risks like that again.
