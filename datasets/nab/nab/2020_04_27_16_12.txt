2020-04-27T16:12:00+10:00 : I reckon I'm down everything I've made out of the Banks in the last 10 yrs, just on share price alone. This is worse than 2009. Now my dividend income has been slashed as well. Ah well, I'll probably qualify for a part pension now, if it gets any worse, full pension here I come. How much is that these days? My next freak-out will be when they take my franking credits to pay for this sh!t-show. The Australians who'll still be paying this off havn't even been born yet.
