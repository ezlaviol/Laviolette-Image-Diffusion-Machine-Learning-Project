NAB has made no comment on what they might expect to pay as the next Div and it is quite probable that at this stage they do hope to pay one.
Regardless of any regulatory directive they will only make that decision based on financials and more importantly how they see the financial situation playing out over the next period.
Note - I expect the Government would also hope that they can pay a Div to avoid further calls of support, however regulatory bodies and the Bank itself need to consider Capital position as a priority if things aren't going well.
