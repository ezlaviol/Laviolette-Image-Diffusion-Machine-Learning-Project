2017-11-06T21:06:00+11:00 : Nothing as high as NAB or banks. But I've been on the yield play via RIO and BHP, which has netted me a massive unrealised profit, and it caught many investors by surprise with the massive rally. But I feel resources are topping, albeit I won't sell them anyway.

Sprinkle your exposure! Also POO is rising and the AUD tanking. WPL (I hold) gone up like 10% in the last 2 weeks. Could be a surprise yield play if oil continues up.

Regardless NAB and the big 4 banks are a quality play and I don't see the RBA rising rates. So the yield is exceptional. Technology developments will only see costs eventually reduce.
