2020-03-28T12:37:00+11:00 : My sense is that although the shock of the coronavirus pandemic is lessening,  the worse (health and economic) is obviously yet to come. The situation in the US is looking grave. Until new infections level off and the disease can be managed in smaller pockets the market will continue to slide downwards for the short to medium term (2-10 weeks, many variables dictate). The market will most likely retest the recent lows and I am still thinking that $8-10 is likely. The market doesn't go down in straight line!
