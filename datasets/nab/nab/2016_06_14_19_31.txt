In the end, horses for courses. 
For me the trick is not to jump right in with both feet at once. Test the water or you might get burnt.
All I need is a decent entry point / average and with the dividends I can hold till I die, literally. If however you are desperate to maximise every 0.1% of your return and have the time, courage, skills and knowledge to be on top of the market at all times you could do something different. If you are likely to need the money in the next few months you should probably do something different. 
Like I said horses for courses and as always DYOR.

And good luck !
