2019-01-08T19:58:00+11:00 : Government policy might change, yes, but the policy I know won't change any time soon is the 6 Pillars Policy, which for some of you will remember was the 4 Pillars Policy before that.  Bought in today for an 8.1% yield.  Not too shabby.Chartists would note that we look to have broken the down trend.Happy for them to trade sideways or drop more I'll buy more. IF (and I think its a big if) they cut the dividend to 90c (which I've heard in the media in the last couple of days) its still a yield of 7 odd percent and will only last a year or so. The Banks never lose! .  The Banks are too tightly entwined in the overall economy.  If the Banks even slow down lending we threaten sending the whole economy into a tailspin.  APRA opened the taps again recently by saying the interest only loan crackdown had done the job.  Rubbish! They are trying to avert an economic contraction.Recession?  Maybe a small one. Unemployment up to 1992 levels?  I just don't smell it.  Banks still didn't go bust.  The banks will always be there like the US Government.At the end of the day I know all 4 big banks are still going to be here in a 100 years.
