Think about the economy and the sectors which have been impacted by Covid19 and how many of them are on the ASX. Tourism - Webjet, Qantas, Flight Centre and Corporate Travel. Hospitality - Woolworths (thru Endeavour and itâ€™s hotel exposure but who else). Banks - all of which have been smashed with shares dropping significantly.
