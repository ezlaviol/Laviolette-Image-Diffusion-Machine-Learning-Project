2020-05-14T08:58:00+10:00 : agree with you horst, a sell off will discourage SPP buyers, I suspect soon it will only be around 5% above the issue price, and a lot of holders will pass on it, however I don't agree about the 'easy money' bit, in 2009 Nab did a SPP at $21.50 and with two months it was trading above $29, all the majors did the same thing with similar price increases, that was definitely easy money, admittedly it doesn't always work, look at WBC SPP late last year, however this Nab one is more akin to the GFC raisings, and remember that was an actual financial crisis, with credit freezing up, this is an external shock that can be resolved faster if a vaccine/treatment is found, (not to mention the massive liquidity being injected) I'm still holding out for a V shaped recovery even though the headlines still look pretty bad
