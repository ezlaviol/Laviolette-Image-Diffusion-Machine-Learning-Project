I replied to someone who said they might not bother voting and stating it was our prerogative (which it is not!!), you somehow(?) turned that into me thinking voting was a "noble" duty and then spouted off about our big bad pollies and that voters are somehow copping out by voting....
You can play the populist sensationalist game and lump every politician into the evil category, good luck to you. Obviously you have grand plans afoot.............

BTW, let me know when you are running for politics, I will just add your name to the long list of blowhards............
