2018-04-19T10:17:00+10:00 : What about asking the following government controlled and managed funds same questions asking the Banks? 

What I not yet heard is the mention of any of the government owned enterprises which are under management of Public Sector Union members who handle $hundreds of millions for their clients. I refer to the various Courts, Public Trustees & Futures Fund who manages the $140 Billion of Public Sector Superannuation funds plus the other $140 billion of unfunded liabilities which would have less staff than the banks to administer the funds in the same manner as the Royal Commissioner is implying the Banks should all offer. 

There are also a number of Trustee Companies which handle a number of secret trusts which even ASIC & Auditors would not be unaware of.  Who handles the William Booth Family Trust and what happens to their $billions?

So if the Royal Commission into Banks has to be more acceptable to those who called this Inquiry it should include all of the above imo.
