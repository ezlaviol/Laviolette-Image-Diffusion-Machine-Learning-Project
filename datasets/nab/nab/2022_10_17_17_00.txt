2022-10-17T17:00:00+11:00 : (Adds context and details) 	   Oct 17 (Reuters) - Australian lender Westpac Banking Corp  (WBC)  has roped in investment bankers from U.S. banking giant JP Morgan to advise it on a bid to buy payment terminals firm Tyro Payments Ltd  (TYR) , the Australian Financial Review reported on Monday. 	The report said Westpac was "one of a handful" of banks mulling a buyout offer and working on the potential benefits of assimilating Tyro into their wider banking operations. 	Australia's top two lenders, Commonwealth Bank of Australia  (CBA)  and National Australia Bank  (NAB) , have also been understood to have considered a play for the payments platform firm, but have not tapped in a counsel yet, the report said without naming any sources. 	The news comes more than a month after Sydney-based Tyro rejected a A$1.27-per-share buyout offer from a consortium led by private equity firm Potentia Capital, calling it "highly opportunistic". 	Tyro shares closed 8.7% higher at A$1.56, but have lost nearly half of their value so far this year. As of Monday's close, Tyro had a market value of A$807.6 million ($503.78 million). 	Both Westpac and Tyro did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. JP Morgan's Australia office also did not respond right away.
