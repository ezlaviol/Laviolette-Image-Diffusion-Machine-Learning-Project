At least I escaped your other fav bank (ANZ) as it peaked last week, and now waiting for the drift down for re-entry..... see I am (slowly) learning to control my fretting hands. Ditto for the "Big Australian" also in the ASX20 (who by the way is falling quickly and so has kept my attention). So as the (now fatter) man sings "two out of three ain't bad".
