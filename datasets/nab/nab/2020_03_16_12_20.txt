It is helpful to hear opposing views.In my opinion, this post quoted isn't impossible.I just hope that if it is bad it is somewhere in between.I definitely agree with the first sentence.  No cases as they haven't been testing.  But as soon as they go elsewhere and get tested it is positive. eg. Peter Dutton, Tom Hanks and wife, Missy Higgin's father etc.Now banned groups exceeding 50 by the CDC.Everyone will then have their opinion as to how that flows through.  In my mind that is not talking the market down, cause not many people in reality use Hot Copper.  But if it gives you something to think about then welcome it.
