Whether or not you have shares at the closing date of the SPP is not important.Similarly, the record date shares go ex div is the only date that matters.  Lastly , NAB has reserved the right to issue less or more under the SPP depending on subscription levels/how they feel.  I would suggest that if you are in any doubt on the SPP wait another week and see how the sp goes.  I have the $'s ready to participate but if I see an opportunity to place the money elsewhere beforehand ( for instance on a dip on my favourite shares ) I will.
