2020-06-03T11:29:00+10:00 : The registry told me that the total number of shares held under both my HIN numbers (same name) would be used for allocation purposes I.e. add the shares in both HINs and that is what is considered as held at record date.The problem now seems to be the lack of communication in how shares were allocated, so I don't know if my 2 shareholdings were added for allocation purposes. Also, from reading other people's allocations here, there doesn't seem to be consistent maths used for allocations.
