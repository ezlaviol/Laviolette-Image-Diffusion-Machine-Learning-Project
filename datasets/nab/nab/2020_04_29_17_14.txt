2020-04-29T17:14:00+10:00 : You’re on a blue chip forum spruiking high risk tech multi baggers as opportunity cost to buying NAB. Preaching to the wrong crowd.I generally only buy index weighted stocks. Maybe 10% of holdings are in the $2bn-$4bn market cap range. Large and mega caps only here. I won’t buy large tech that have little to no earnings either. You’re looking to get rich, and quick. I am doing wealth maintenance hence my index base benchmarks. Completely different goals and probably FUM. Funds management is exactly what I am doing.I don’t need to find the next Microsoft or CSL. Albeit CSL was always a large cap since listing and you’ll probably find Microsoft was too relative to the times. Most large caps stay unlisted now due to PE pension money, then list as a large cap. Look at Facebook, exactly that. They only need to list once they breach ownership rules and or initial PE investors want out. They also flog a lot of crap off to naive investors too.
