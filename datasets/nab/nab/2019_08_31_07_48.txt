2019-08-31T07:48:00+10:00 : Just an observation - people complain about the big 4 banks in Australia being too big but you seem to be fearful of too many banks in Australia and that there should be a consolidation process. This happened in the 1970's and 1980's and that is why we do have the big 4 banks we have now. You have a sell recommendation for NAB at least (and I will extend an assumption that you would have for the other 3 big Australian banks) so that seems to be somewhat contradictory.I would also suggest that the regulations now being applied to bank lending practices are not coming from the banks directly but from the regulatory framework as a result of the royal commission.In addition, I would suggest that most people attack the big 4 banks but conveniently  distinguish them from other companies - Banks are profit making commercial entities as well. They are not charities . Strong profitable banks are necessary for a strong economy.

BANK CUSTOMERS HAVE BECOME ELITE UNDER APRARaw numbers for just 3 main known lenders of BNPL reveal the following customer numbers and many of whom would not have a chance at getting a bank housing loan and more likely to be renters perhaps.APT  has 4,600,000 customersFXL has 1,700,000 Z1P has 1,300,000 Total   7.6 million customers banks have lost assuming customers don't have accounts with all three providers plus bank credit cards .How can RBA & APRA claim they can save our banks and economy with so many people shut out of the direct banking lending system? NAB lends money to APT & Westpac to ZIP so there must be a risk to both these banks.  So how do APRA claim they can save customers from borrowing too much by forcing them to accept APT, ZIP & FXL payment systems at much higher costs than bank credit cards? I measure an additional cost in view banks are taking a dim view of anyone using BNPL services when applying for a home loan and the risk of getting a bad credit score is higher using these services. There are just too many banks and many should be consolidating by merging asap.#banking #nab #rba #westpac #economy #realestate #monetarypolicy #finance #apra #ceos
