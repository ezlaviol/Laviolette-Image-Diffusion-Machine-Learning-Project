2016-04-30T07:35:00+10:00 : I am interested in other peoples opinion about NAB's SP as I think it is way undervalued and is likely to return to above $30 in the next few months.

It seems to me that it's business as usual and a 99c dividend can again be expected next month.  It has taken actions with the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks which is allowing them to focus on the main game now.  What do others think?
