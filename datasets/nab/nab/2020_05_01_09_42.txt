Also, there's plenty of the "and more"."rather than being here arguing over this and that."Friendly discursive discussion and banter (well, most of the time anyway) on "Australia's largest stock trading and investment forum", isn't that what it's for?  As @madamswer often says when he/she gets asked why he/she is posting on a stock not held "the rasion d'etre of a stock discussion forum (as distinct from a stock cheer-leading forum)". The reason I got drawn in here was the big drop in the banks so thought I'd have a look, but decided not for me, even at these prices, I've got some cash in hand so who knows, they may drop back and pique my interest again.Anyway, you have a good day and good luck with your investing.
