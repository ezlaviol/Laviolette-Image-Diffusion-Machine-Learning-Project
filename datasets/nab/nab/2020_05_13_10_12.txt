2020-05-13T10:12:00+10:00 : ?? NAB do not know what price shares will be issued at or exact formula for a scale back if done!
To be clear (as has been said many times) $14-15 is max price.
Sentiment in market at the moment could see SPP shares issued in line with the lower calculation which would make any exact figure pointless even without a scale back
Makes sense to just apply for an amount.
