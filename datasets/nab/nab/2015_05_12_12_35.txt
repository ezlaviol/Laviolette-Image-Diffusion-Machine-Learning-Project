2015-05-12T12:35:00+10:00 : I will bet you that NAB will be a lot cheaper than today. It is forming a new downtrend. And remember what happens during the last GFC, it dropped more than 50%. The economy is worse now than during the GFC. Debt levels are rising and everyone is requiring more capital just to survive and put food on their table. If you look at the weekly and monthly charts alone. NAB has a long way to fall. The downside will be severe if the charts are right. Funny how people have this strange idea that a capital raising is bad for penny stocks but wonderful for blue chips. A capital raising is a capital raising, no matter which company does it. If you require moiney, you are doing something wrong. It is all smoke and mirrors and mind games.
