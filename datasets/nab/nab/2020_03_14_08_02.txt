2020-03-14T08:02:00+11:00 : I don't want to get into the weeds on that stuff and it's not my area of expertise. My point is we've had a lot of health things (Ebola, SARS, swine flu, etc etc) which seem scary at the time but don't really affect markets/economies longer term. Sadly this one seems to be weaponised by the government taking more liberties away such as the right of assembly (banning gatherings). Anyone got my copy of 1984?
