2020-10-16T14:46:00+11:00 : sell, take profits and buy back .. the recent rally in SP is by institutions trying to push it up prior to div announcements, or any important fin calendar event.. and then it come rolling down at least 5 to 10% over the following weeks.. which is when i buy.. and ride up the wave.. you should be able to catch this back around low 17s by mid Nov (just after div announcement).. wait for it to drop..
