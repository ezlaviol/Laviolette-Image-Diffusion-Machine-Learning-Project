The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said it was partnering with Commonwealth Bank  (CBA) , National Australia Bank  (NAB) , Perpetual and ConsenSys Software, a blockchain technology company, on the collaborative project. 	The project will involve the development of a proof-of-concept for the issuance of a tokenised form of CBDC that can be used by wholesale market participants for the funding, settlement and repayment of a tokenised syndicated loan on an Ethereum-based DLT platform.
