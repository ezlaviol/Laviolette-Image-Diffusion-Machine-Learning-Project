How is APT and other growth stocks higher risk that NAB?in my opinion NAB is higher risk as they are in decline, being disrupted, paying too much dividend (shockingly poor capital management) and have longer term macroeconomic headwinds. Buying NAB, or even holding, is a speculative investment, with not much upside. If I held banks I would sell if they rebound buy bonds if I wanted a distribution and low risk. But I don't because they have poor Management as well as the above reasons.nab hasn't beaten that accumulation index btw. Lower return than corporate bonds.
