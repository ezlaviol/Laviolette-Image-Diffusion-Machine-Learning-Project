Chuck in RBA cash rate cuts and obviously dividends aren't going to be down.... You cant paid out profit, if it isnt there....If we are realistic here the worst is yet to come, this is the reality people need to realise. IF in the rare event Australia could contain COVID-19 with lockdowns, then what? Re-open borders? Let the virus in again? It would be great for Australia but we still would have limited ability for future economic growth with the rest of the world dealing with the virus and a clean Australia - thats a best case scenario in the short term.Long term the best case is a vaccine. This could be 18 months or more away per medical experts.This isnt a GFC event, this will be an ongoing battle for months to come. This is the new reality and the stock market hasnt fully digested this information yet. Not fear-mongering or being bearish this is just reality....
