2020-05-18T17:09:00+10:00 : Probably because the big volumes won't affect the share price in the aftermarket auctions with brokers clients and it's expected that financial stocks will get a rise tomorrow on the back of the DOW futures rise through the day. No guarantees though on what the DOW does overnight but expected to start off in positive territory unless news events make it not so. My take on it anyway.
