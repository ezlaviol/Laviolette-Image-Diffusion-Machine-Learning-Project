2016-06-21T15:55:00+10:00 : In terms of how we can make money in the stock market predicting events... bookies are probably a good reflection of market sentiment rather than the polls- I mean the polls are showing Labor in Aus on around 50/50 two party preferred, sometimes in front even 51/49. So the odds clearly aren't reflecting that. Maybe they reflect seat by seat polling showing the LNP ahead in key marginal seats.  Maybe they are reflecting the general sentiment.

To make money: if however the odds were $1.60 you could say there is a fair degree of uncertainty, accept the evil bank's SP will immediately do better with an LNP victory, asses the LNP win as highly likely and buy bank stocks.

But the LNP @ $1.12 sums up the mood of not only punters but also I think means a LNP win is well priced in to the SP. So the only way to make money on the election is to back a particularly unexpected Labor win by shorting your ar$e off. Not you Nanood who doesn't short. And not me who, sadly, sees no prospect of that.

By the way, when the campaign started I thought $3.50 was a good price for Labor. But you can't buy and sell them like options and I didn't want to be holding on expiry day  In fact I was waiting for the LNP to creep up to $1.60 but they never got there. The best has been $1.37 a couple of weeks ago.

Also I don't think UK and US polling usually suffers from non-compulsory voting, which is why the UK 2015 result was such a surprise.
