There is always something going on to unsettle things, Brexit, our election, Fed meetings re US rates, OPEC, etc. Trouble is half the time even if the outcome is obvious, Mr Market's reaction to the outcome is not always predictable. Maybe its Mrs Market (fickle, brutal but ever so alluring!).

I think that's why it's OK to be partially in. eg I don't mind holding NAB @ 27.25. At worst (assuming dividend is maintained which I think is safe to do so) its 10.38% p.a. return after franking credits, with no hassles .
