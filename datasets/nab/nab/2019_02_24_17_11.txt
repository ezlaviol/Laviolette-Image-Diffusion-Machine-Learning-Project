NAB has had some acquisition shockers , an early standout being the US foray (Homeside) then of course more recently UK episode. Selling off a poorly performing business technically reduces your overall size however is usually only done to improvc overall performance
Conversely NAB's Australian competitors purchased businesses in recent times which increased their size, most notably Westpac taking over St George, CBA, Bankwest etc. Quite a few others, however the point is that overall size is not just a factor of trading performance.
I am not sticking up for any NAB bosses however to use a measure such as changing size against peers makes no sense at all.
