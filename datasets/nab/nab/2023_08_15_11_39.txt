NAB is never a long term hold for me, i just play the ups and downs. i am watching closely, at this stage mid $29â€™s still a sell for me unless something changes.i am also conscious of a potential correction Sept/October. this is a combination of a "feeling" and probably way to much research on my part.nice up tick today on results.. the buyback can only help strengthen its sp. and fingers crossed but .82c div would be nice later this year.good luck.
