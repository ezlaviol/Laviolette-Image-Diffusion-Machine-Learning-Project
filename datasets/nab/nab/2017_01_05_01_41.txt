2017-01-05T01:41:00+11:00 : Fed hikes and Trumps reads to me there is going to be a loosening of money market...thinking a continuing banking rally is assured. 
Of course with Trump...it could well go awry... but short to medium term...thinking financial sector is a hotty. Been pleasantly surprised actually at the overall recent momentum. 
Barely watch this stock...but thought I'd throw one in...
Cheers
