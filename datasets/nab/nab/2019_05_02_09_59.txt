The Board would have deliberated quite a lot to cut it this much and will no doubt wear a lot of flack from shareholders about (further) wealth destruction. They won't want to do it again in a hurry. My guess is that this is a "clearing the decks" type of cut, It would take a significant downturn for a further cut from this level. That said if economic conditions deteriorate and/or further regulation is imposed (eg increasing CET requirements, increasing the 'bank levy") a further cut is possible but I would imagine the Board sees 83c (166c annually) as the new norm. Its around 70-75% payout ratio and at current share price 6.4-6.5%ff.
