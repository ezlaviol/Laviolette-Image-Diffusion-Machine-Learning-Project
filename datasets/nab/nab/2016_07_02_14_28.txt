Tuesday should be a good day. NAB dividends are a sure thing. My (Li)ttle friend is in a halt until Tuesday. Hope the announcement is a big one, but you never know and as they say it's not over till the fat lady sings, or until you close your position. 

Agree that BEN has more to run but it has had a rally in the last few days as opposed to the others so I was thinking it might retrace. If it does I might jump back in. 

Don't think cba will cut the dividends but you just can't tell. I think you are correct in that if they do Mrs Market will punish the Sp, and I will be ready. 

I have also prevoted. Will just watch the circus on TV tonight now. If Alp win, Monday will be very interesting. Still strapped in everywhere else. I am getting deja-vu.
