2018-08-14T17:06:00+10:00 : NAB Unaudited 3Q Cash Earnings A$1.65 Bln. For half yearly basis (assuming same trend continue) that is 3.3 Billion which is exactly what was last Half Yearly.. on EPS basis (I am not an expert) Annual EPS comes to $2.40/Share which is much higher that what market was expecting EPS  around $2.17/Share range..Market was expecting a drop of almost 9% which did not happen. I expect NAB share price to rebound in same way as happened to CBA share price
