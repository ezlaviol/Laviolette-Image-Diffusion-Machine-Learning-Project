2017-06-26T16:52:00+10:00 : They federal liberal government framed it wrong. You can't just add a tax to a business or sector without a rationale beyond 'you have heaps of money and nobody likes you anyway'. Similar to Labor's mining tax. Just set the tax rate to the necessary level and leave it there. They only just cut some company tax rates, now they need to tax some other companies higher to make up the shortfall. Morons. At the moment its total disarray, privatising income streams with one hand whilst nationalising with the other. 

However there is a good rationale for charging the big 4 extra - which is that the Australia will back up their debt in the event of a crisis and they are charging a fee for this insurance. Framed the right way it would remind investors that the government is not about to start filling budget deficits by reaching into every successful company beyond the pre-agreed 30% corporate tax rate on profits. It would seem fair to charge it as an insurance levy, which would remind investors that the fee comes with an additional layer of security on the investment, as well reassure that its not going to be so easily reapplied, as the fee doesn't come without service.

Liberals are absolutely trashing their reputation as economic managers, wasting that political capital on absolutely nothing worthwhile.
