2020-04-27T14:35:00+10:00 : you’re using a pointless period to compare. This is a crisis, hence my view buying opportunity. Also again, you’re ommitting dividends which is 101 mistake. They pay out a huge % of profits to dividends. So those returns are wrong. Funds management will report dividend inclusive. The returns are positive once you add back dividends and franking effect.if you use the 1990s recession as a benchmark with the accumulation of dividends you’ll magically find the bank stocks look amazing. You’re cherry picking and using a false figure via a basic chart which doesn’t factor dividends.
