2016-11-16T14:54:00+11:00 : The relative surge of CBA into the 77s was unexpected. In comparative terms, NAB should be worth about $34 based on size of business, metrics, capital levels, portfolios good and/or bad. 

Offshore fundies might only find one bank or company worth investing in otherwise the comparative SPs do not make sense to me between NAB without CYB and the current CBA.
