2018-11-01T18:16:00+11:00 : In the Investor presentation it shows "FY18 payout ratio 82.6% (excluding restructuring and customer remediation costs) and 74% with normal DRP3 participation"....

I gather if there are more of these one-offs going forward, it would be a challenge to continue with this dividend/payout ratio unless they dig into their reserves/borrowings, sell something?
