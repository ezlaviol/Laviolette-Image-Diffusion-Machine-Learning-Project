Might be a case that the legal costs defending them will be higher. They will face some head winds but I think there was a general panic and the shares (all banks really) were over sold off.Still recall that the dividend has not changed for a few years (maybe that will happen but I can't see that declining very much either if it does) and the SP has been in a rough range of $24-35 over that time. NAB has still made a similar profit over that time as well plus, they have left behind that UK millstone around the company's neck.A $30 SP still makes NAB a good investment and a longer term hold for me anyway.

My guess is no one knows what total remediation costs will be post RC. So while the business may be sounds some big licks potentially to come as we see class actions etc move through the courts Not RC related but watch for another payout to be announced next week just on disruption to phone banking this week imo. Remember we paid $30m for the issues with Eftpos terminals last year to compensate for disruption to retailers. Everyone will have their hand out and the bank will be more than willing to pay out to repair its image in the community.
