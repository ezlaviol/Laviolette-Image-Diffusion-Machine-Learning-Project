2016-06-27T16:25:00+10:00 : Not so bad, 70c or so shaved off at open but rebounding a little during trade... A little bit of Russian roulette happening tonight with EU & USA markets the real action is likely tomorrow depending on the lead they set.

If those markets are green tonight then buyers from today will be smiling tomorrow.
