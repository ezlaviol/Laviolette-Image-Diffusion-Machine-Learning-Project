History lesson 1In the beginning, god made the world and uttered "let there be banks", and the word of god was made true, and so they went forth and multiplied through out the lands, and became embedded within all cultures great and small. And to this very day they stand as a symbol of all wealth and prosperity, and the hallmark of mankinds greatest acheivements. Beware, the lord will strike down all those who vilify the banks.
