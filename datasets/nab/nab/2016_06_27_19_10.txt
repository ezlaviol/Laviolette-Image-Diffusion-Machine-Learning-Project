2016-06-27T19:10:00+10:00 : It looks like the FTSE 250 is down about 3.4% right now, not sure about the banking sector specifically but unless the FTSE can rebound it sets up the ASX for a fair old shellacking tomorrow.

Still plenty of water to go under the bridge tonight and of course the DJIA will be another influence.
