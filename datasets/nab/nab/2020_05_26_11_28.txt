2020-05-26T11:28:00+10:00 : NAB share price seems to be on a rocket past couple of days.... there seems to be plenty of positive sentiment at the moment I.e. unwinding the covid lockdown, underestimation of job keeper numbers, extra money now available to continue economic stimulus if required, improving business confidence, global covid recovery  etc.I think this share price positive sentiment will continue until at least September, so those hoping to stag sell next week should  be happy with their exit price..I personally think we'll see at least $17 to $18 in July, possibly more by September.
