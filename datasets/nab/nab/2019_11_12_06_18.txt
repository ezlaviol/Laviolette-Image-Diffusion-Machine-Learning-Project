I think AMP is a bit unique in that regard.In the case of MLC, they are fairly successful and NAB is off-loading it to clean its house rather than get rid of a losing enterprise. Maybe that is difference.

The AMP debacle today will have a terrible impact on sentiment towards MLC and NAB. Charging the dead and the spectre of these problems not being cleared up has awful implications for NAB and CBA as well as AMP.Looks like the Banking Code of Practise is a bit of waste of time in Australia, it has not changed anything by the looks of the AMP example.
