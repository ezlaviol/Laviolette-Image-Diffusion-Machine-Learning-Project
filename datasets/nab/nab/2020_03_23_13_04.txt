I remember buying into CBA at around $28 during the last GFC and people saying you have done your dosh when  it went down another 20% from my entry. Well dividends were slashed but over time the SP recovered and dividends hit new highs so much so we were getting a 20% return PA in dividends on our original entry price.Yes its carnage everywhere you look but in years to come people will look back and curse they did not have the guts to buy these beaten down stocks in these troubled times. Instead of trying to time the market like @h00ts is saying its best to keep your power dry until we have positive evidence we have turned the corner and we are on the way back up. Better to miss out on some of the gains than try to catch a falling knife Let that knife hit the floor first and know the only way is up even if it means you might reduce your upside in the process.. I only bought back in from now to give my family some peace of mind and even if we see a 30% drop or more from here you can bet your bottom dollar in 5 years from now all these beaten down stocks would of come close to recovering their SP and some like A2M will be reaching new SP highs.All this is just my opinion, not financial advice,  based on every event in the past that has triggered a big once in a ten year drop like we are experiencing now.
