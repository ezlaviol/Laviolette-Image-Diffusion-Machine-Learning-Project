2020-05-06T18:36:00+10:00 : This nasty bastard flu has killed over 250,000 people (worldwide) in a few months.If the Federal and State governments hadn't acted so well so early then the number of people infected within Australia would be in the order of multiples of current numbers, placing a huge burden on not only our medical system but the economy as well. In the broad scheme of things a few years of financial hardship will be nothing compared to what could have been. No person in Australia under the age of thirty has had to endure a recession in this country due to good management and good luck, so realistically no adult under the age of fifty has had to endure hardships as the bread winner/s due to a recession.So perhaps the second Mercedes will have to go?
