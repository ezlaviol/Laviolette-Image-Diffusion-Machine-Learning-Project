2017-06-14T15:41:00+10:00 : I'm still here and still think at least $30.60. I feel the rally hasn't even started yet.

Last weeks pull back to $20.09 was just a scare and made sense to me serving two purposes, a revisit to the 30 May low also filled the gap made on 8 December and building positive divergence on the RSI and DMI, Money Flow Index.

From today, a think a little weakness maybe back to low $30, then the proper push up to $30.60 and maybe more to $31.
