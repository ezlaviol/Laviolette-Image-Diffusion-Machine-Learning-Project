Academic to your post though While things are not "normal" being pessimistic is a waste of time. There are many pointers to an improvement on the current situation - and, for the banks, 12-18 months may be flat but there are few issues left to be dealt with.Pessimistic people tend to have short views for the future. Maybe next Tuesday could look ordinary but Tuesday a year from now holds a lot of promise.
