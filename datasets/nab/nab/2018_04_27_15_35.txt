2018-04-27T15:35:00+10:00 : Tq Remark,... a few takeaways from here that I could think of :-

1) So,.. ALL the banks will drop together when ONE report like this comes out, in spite of the fact that this report is specifically for WBC ONLY. I said ALL because even my 'regional' BOQ also plunged yesterday.
2) The volume of 17.07 million for WBC signals very well the co-relation between such a report and WBC's performance, and performance of the other 3 banks from the Big Four too.
3) Investors do take these news hard - we can see the share price has not recovered much till now.
