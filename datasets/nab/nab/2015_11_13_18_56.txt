If you did not like it you could have just simply stated that it is too risky and you think investing your money more wisely is the go. Instead you call me a retard and get very arrogant. Firstly, any retard who is paying $300 or more for brokerage has no idea in the first place. Secondly of course they were historical lows you idiot and look how they bounced. Today on a day when we were down over 100 points did we touch those lows again? NAB and ANZ were both down over 10% when I bought them Tuesday at their previous near lows and I was happy with my decision as I made money yesterday on both.
