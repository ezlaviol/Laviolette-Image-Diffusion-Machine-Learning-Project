Anyway, you see no reason that the dividend will be cut this year, but the market is indicating that it will. The market is a whole pile of individuals comparing beliefs, some better informed than others, but all holding an opinion. I don't believe your opinion is well informed, but it does add into the overall market (assuming you are buying big time at current prices of course). But there were sellers last week at $23 just as there were buyers a couple of years ago at $40.I am currently transitioning my SMSF to income in preparation for retirement so my purchase of NAB is based on my expectations of the dividend relative to other companies I might consider. If I am right about that I will not care that much what the share price does (within limits of course, because a significant fall in price would cause me to doubt my dividend expectations going forward). I am budgeting on a 7% yield, and hoping that I get to keep the franking credits as well, the market and voters being willing!
