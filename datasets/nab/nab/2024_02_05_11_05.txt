2024-02-05T11:05:00+11:00 : Saturday, went to Melton NAB wanting to deposit a Medibank Private cheque (we'd switched to BUPA).Inserted Visa card.  Keyed in Visa credit card number ( why did we have to do that ????)Fed in cheque.   Nope.  Didnt like it.   It wasnt badly creased.Tried again with cheque upside down ... Nope ... tried backwards ... nope ... forwards ... nope.Ok ...Try next day in Chadstone NAB ... this time we didnt have to key in the Visa Card Number.   Great. But unable to insert cheque ... ???Try again.Then see  a small sign saying this ATM has been updated and cheques are inserted in slot top left. Great.But ... cheque rejected.
