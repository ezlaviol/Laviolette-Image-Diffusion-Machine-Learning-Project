2016-08-23T13:19:00+10:00 : Once again Nabtrade not functioning properly. Had a sale go thru nearly an hour ago but proceeds don't show in available balance. Can't get thru on phone. This type of problem happens frequently. Perhaps time to change broker. As a NAB sh/der worried about enormous damage to their brand.
