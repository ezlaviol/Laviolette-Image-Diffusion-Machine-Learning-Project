2020-05-12T16:38:00+10:00 : Not saying covid isn’t bad, as clearly it is.However the death rate for covid without a vaccine is actually much lower than the flu that has a vaccine (Yes..... The numbers actually suck for both). Hep B killed 90% more people here in Australia last year than corona. Hep C even higher. TB (contagious but bacterial ....higher yet again. The Flu? Depends on the year but it is also generally higher. Heart disease makes The contagious look like a blip and they are now related as the real fallout from locking down the economy will come from poverty, so expect much higher rates of heart attack kills 60- 70% of people pre povid (sic). domestic violence, mental health (suicides) and more,  well and I mean well exceeding the death rate from the virus for a much longer time. Was it good to lock down? Maybe... Maybe not. The government made a choice good bad or indifferent.  I’m sure 90% of people disagree but I think the problem evolved from the greed of universities getting students into the country by whatever risk. I appreciate I may be 180 degrees from the official compassion fatigue narrative.  Having said this hope everyone stays safe I just don’t think the government got it right- and now everyone pays. It is what it is. Personal opinion. Sentiment.... Buy long term but not yet. Factor in the fallout from povid-20/21.
