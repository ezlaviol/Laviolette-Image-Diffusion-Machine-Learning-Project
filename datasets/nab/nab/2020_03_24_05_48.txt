Not such a bad result.I can't claim that I can pick the bottom but I have been buying on the way down.. Downturn in the SP has to be seen as a temporary set back and it is not teminal nor will it become the norm. It just may take six months.

Macquarie have put out that NAB could cut the dividend to $1.49 then to $1.33. even at the lower end its around 10% on todays price.This mess is far from over but I guess its a matter of determining what you consider to be an income stream you can live with, lock it in and ignore the price.$500k today will pay just on $50k pa assuming a 20% cut in the current div.No doubt $13.88 is not the low but 2 years from now a 10% return will or there abouts will be fantastic whilst the cash rate will still probably be zero.
