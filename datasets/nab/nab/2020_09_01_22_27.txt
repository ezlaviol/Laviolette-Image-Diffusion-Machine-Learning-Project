2020-09-01T22:27:00+10:00 : So where to at the open?I topped up a bit when we were 3% down today.So clawed some of the days losses back. Am sitting at an average of 17.395. So amazingly I am marginally in front.I personally think we have been way oversold and the sale of MLC will bode well.I am bullish enough to be topping up at this price, with an expectation of 22.00 +, when Covid is resolved, and I expect a return to full dividends by 2022.
