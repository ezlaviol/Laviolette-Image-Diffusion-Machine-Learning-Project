Personally, I think it will have a high of $32 which assumes the world markets improve, NAB continues to make the same or larger profits than last year, and pays the same dividends.  Really, it depends on the international markets.  Everyone will different views and make different assumptions.  That's okay.  Best Wishes and LOL.
