If Monday has a bounce I think it will prove the over reaction and I'm sure a lot of people will be buying in on the prospect of cheap shares. While I think nab is reasonable value I would consider 24 and below to be cheap based on how far away the divs are, if they are maintained and still the uncertainty of political movements. Traders do love their volitility so might be a whole bunch of bouncing around coming up. Will be no shortage of news to panic about now from Europe. Be surprised if the media has any time for China for a while. Bigger headlines coming up. Luckily for us our economy won't really see that much effect bar the ripple effect. Hopefully the Australian people will look at the LNP as being the more responsible money managers than "Borrow it Bill" in the upcoming election.
