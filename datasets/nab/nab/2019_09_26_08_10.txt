2019-09-26T08:10:00+10:00 : I think negative interest rates will hurt NAB more than the others.i would use the market upside reaction to the President Trump impeachment trial leaving his re-election as a near certainty, as a good opportunity to offload prior to the start of the cuts by the RBA.Less delinquencies due to lower or negative rates is unlikely to help NAB as much as the others especially WBC and ANZ IMHO.
