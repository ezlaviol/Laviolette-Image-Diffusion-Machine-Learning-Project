2017-09-04T17:20:00+10:00 : I like NAB as a yield play.

I was updating some financial records today and thought I would share this spreadsheet illustrating wealth creation over time (light blue line at the top) following the simple rules of a) consistency, b) looking for reasonable (but not magical) yields, and most importantly c) the compounding of returns by reinvesting them along the way.

As you can see the chart is fairly flat for the first  half or so, but the last 25%-30% of the chart has taken on a very sharp and consistent upturn.

I've only kept the spreadsheet for 11 yrs and you can see it starts at around $80K so add another 15-20yrs spent building that up prior to the chart start point.

No voodoo, no magic beans, just time.
