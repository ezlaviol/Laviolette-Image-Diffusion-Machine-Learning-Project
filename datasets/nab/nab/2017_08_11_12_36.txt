For this full year we remain confident of achieving more than $200 million in productivity savings and, excluding the impact of the bank levy, expect to deliver positive ‘jaws’.

---------------------------------

So, they can save more than 200M for this FY, but I wondered how much will this 200M contribute towards paying-up the federal bank levy. They are NOT including the bank levy effect into their 'confident results' for this FY,... they have to, right ? Doesn't seem right not to consider the levy, after all, it has to be paid-up to the federal gov't.
