The devil, as always, will be in the detail about risk management and when to jump off. I am sure you will be just fine. 

I am still letting the runners go, but I am starting to nibble away at the banks now. I donâ€™t like having all my funds in non blue chip companies. The banks will have their time, as all sectors do. As you know, at least with the banks, if there is a decent correction and you get caught holding them, you can at least collect the dividends while you are in the waiting room.
