2020-04-30T22:10:00+10:00 : can I have some of the stuff your smoking? Even after falling close to 50% it’s still one of the top 10 companies by market cap in Australia. Sheesh, it’s still probably top 30-40 in the world in banking....this will be above $20 once COVID-19 is over with the other 2 banks. I own all of them in similar quantities, CBA still the biggest holding though however I haven’t bought any more in years.
