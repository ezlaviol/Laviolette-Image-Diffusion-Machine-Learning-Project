Preserve capital.

Keep some powder dry.

If buying, don't jump in balls & all on anything, because the odds are against you.

I've been buying parcels of this & that over the last 6-18 months as things became appealing, prices have looked cheap.

But I have to say it's mostly been a mistake, this market is going nowhere. I've put the cue back in the rack and it's the best decision I've made over the last 3-6 months as every time a share price has screamed "bargain" it has failed to bounce very far and often sunk below the bargain price in short time. Money in the bank will outperform many stocks this year IMHO.
