Especially when they were the only bank who raised equity at fire sale prices. However, you’d need a severe housing meltdown to see the banks in trouble. The banks have the equity to absorb a material fall in house prices, they are required so by the capital adequacy ratios which are good in this county. However, on top of this we have minimum, a 20% buffer or more on a net basis for equity on top of bad debts. It’s not all doom, not to say it can’t happen. House prices are in a massive bubble, but again a major correction would only take the froth away from the last 2 years. A large portion of mortgages are pre this period, thus insulated.I still see house prices going down 15%, but I don’t think it’s a negative impact to banks at this point.
