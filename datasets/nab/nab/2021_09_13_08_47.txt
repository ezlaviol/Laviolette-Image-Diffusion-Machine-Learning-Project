This poster was one of the NAB naysayers around SPP time 5/2020 and I posted  in response to another poster who was trying to explain simple logic to him/her of buying NAB in the mid teens!

"Anyway moving on from the scaremongering my guess is OP is a disgruntled ex employee.. Or perhaps disgruntled ex customer (See plenty of them from time to time on various bank threads)" -
To suggest NAB is/was the only bank that spent money to lure/retain valuable customers or reward staff is ludicrous I have little doubt that money has been wasted at times and I'm sure anyone that's been in business for some time will remember the heady days of the '80's & '90's when lunch was an event and bankers could be relied on to ensure a late night at any shindig. Times have certainly changed.............
(Nice to know his/her mum wasn't having long lunches at CBA but I think his friend at Macquarie might be telling a few porkies although "being respectful of shareholder funds" is no doubt subjective, or perhaps they were just happy to buy a nice bottle of Dom with their bonuses to drink at home!!)
Seems strange that NAB has maintained it's financial performance while having a workforce of drunken yobos and apparently not chaining their worthless lap tops to their desks!!
