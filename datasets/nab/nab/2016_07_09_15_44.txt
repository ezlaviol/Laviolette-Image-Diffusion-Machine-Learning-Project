2016-07-09T15:44:00+10:00 : I saw the ratings outlook downgrade the other day and thought to myself "there is the trigger for lower margins/profits, reduction in dividend to follow, and of course the share price is now likely to be massaged down accordingly."

They may even reduce dividends now as a capital preservation strategy as they need to raise $7 billion over the next two yrs in order to avoid the credit downgrade.

Sit back & watch for a while this is going to take some time to play out.
