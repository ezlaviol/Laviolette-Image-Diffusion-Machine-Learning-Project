 The SPI is pointing to a lower start for the Australian share market as local traders get set to absorb the Australian Government’s Federal Budget release last night. Over the current financial year the deficit is forecast to be $41.1 billion, or 2.6 per cent of GDP, but predicted to narrow to 0.4 per cent of GDP over the next four years. Also included a lower tax rate for small businesses, a $3.5 billion childcare package, a crack down on multinational tax avoidance and a GST on digital products sold by international companies.

Federal Budget perspectives

  

 National Australia Bank Limited (ASX:NAB) has highlighted the modest but nonetheless positive market reaction to the Budget. The bank says it does not pose any immediate threat to the AAA rating and following its release the dollar pushed higher and bond futures improved. NAB believes the budget is relatively neutral in its impact on the broader economy and new expenditures have been broadly offset by savings. After NAB raised $2.7 billion from institutional investors yesterday and exited a trading halt its shares fell 1.87 per cent to close at $34.54 on Tuesday. 

  

 AMP Limited (ASX:AMP) has forecast this year’s Budget should be far more positive for confidence than last years but believes a return to surplus is looking more distant. AMP has also noted the shift in focus from budget repair towards supporting growth and fairness and says new spending has been more than offset by various savings. AMP Capital Investors Chief Economist Shane Oliver believes the impact on the share market is likely to be minimal. Shares in AMP rose 0.63 per cent to close at $6.39 on Tuesday.
