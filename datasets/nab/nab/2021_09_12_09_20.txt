2021-09-12T09:20:00+10:00 : Always a good idea to take investment advice from an obviously disgruntled ex-employee.I worked for a company for 40 years mainly in marketing roles and while I certainly didn't like what I considered wasted money especially in "relationship" building activities, later on I realised it was small change in relation  to the amount of money that was at stake keeping staff and customers "aligned". Managers certainly had budgets and authorisation levels that they could not exceed I would be more worried about security issues in regards to PC, phones etc which are minor costs compared to personnel costs.
