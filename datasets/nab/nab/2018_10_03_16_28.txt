2018-10-03T16:28:00+10:00 : Today just closed under a major support line. Major bearish move IMO. Supply line (thick green line) seems to be a reliable resistance line as it touches many points on the way down. Today the stock tried to rally but it was broken right before it touched the supply line.As a disclosure I'm short on NAB, and I think its a good bet. I think tomorrow will be a red day, but could see some consolidation before we go lower.
