2020-03-12T09:22:00+11:00 : Real bids are placed seconds before market opens. Current bids are not indicative of any thing. Pre-Open fake bids are pretty common to scare people or to lure in greed at higher open (When opening is higher while big fellow wants to sell as happened yesterday)... The 8918 bid is probably linked to some Margin Call. Forced Selling at the open is pretty common. ...That is what happened two days back. Opened at 18.89 then closed as 21.10
