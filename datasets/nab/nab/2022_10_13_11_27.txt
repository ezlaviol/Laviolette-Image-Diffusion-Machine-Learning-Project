2022-10-13T11:27:00+11:00 : i have been playing nab for years nowremember i called it a yoyo stock a while back....up down up downi bought a heap when everyone freaked out with the first rate rise at $26.60 i think (when all banks fell off a cliff), and unloaded not long after at around $31+. i remember all the doomsdayers on here at the time.. quite funny really. i just told everyone to dive in and buy!i got wbc at $19ANZ at $21.99CBA at $87despite brokers relentless SELL on CBA, it just plods along doing it's thing, and doing it well.anyway NAB, i almost bought back in at mid/high $28's last week but i have my cut offs and step ins and it just needed to drop alittle bit more. which it didn'toh well.. I'll catch the next retracethis is NAB we're talking about after allall in my opinion.. and certainly not financial advice :-]
