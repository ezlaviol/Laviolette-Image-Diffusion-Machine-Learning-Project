You've made assumptions about those who are getting assistance (most are getting that assistance not through their own choice and because society (at the moment) is not operating as it should because of COVID-19.You have also totally ignored the beneficial impact of that assistance on the economy through increased demand.The course you have outlaid may have worked in medieval times when pitch forking the peasants was accepted. It is not an acceptable course in a modern society. Plus, it is detrimental to the economy as well.

my wording was harsh but purely from a financial perspective only - all the people on any form of government assistance regardless of fault or reason is a financial burden on society and will deepen the recession unless they get off it.  it's that simple.
