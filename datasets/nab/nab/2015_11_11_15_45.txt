DRP = Dividend re-investment plan. You elect to take this option up to get your dividend entitlement issued in new shares instead of a cash payment. The purchase price of those shares is determined by the weighted trading price over a certain date range as outlined in the results. For this dividend payment it's the 11th of November to the 19th of November.
