CBA are the 'lucky' bank.  They have the advantage (and always have) of being the 'deposit king'  This started many many years ago when they were Gov owned..  you had to have a CBA account to receive welfare.. many customers of those old days still bank as do their families etc. etc. with the CBA explaining the massive MC of the CBA to the other three.. all just IMO.
