At the moment you could be paying up to 17% extra on franked dividends  i.e. 47% personal tax rate vs the company rate of 30%. If labour get in, it appears franking credits disappear and you need to pay the full 47% tax on your dividends and your super will not be getting any franking credits either. Good luck with that. The less tax that is paid to any Government is the best option because I think I can spend more wisely than they can.
