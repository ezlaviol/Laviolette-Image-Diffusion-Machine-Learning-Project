2019-02-23T04:37:00+11:00 : Giz I have nearly double the ANZ shares in my SMSF as NAB. I bought up ANZ when they were the worst of the Big 4. Currently my focus is on NAB as it appears to be the worst of the Big 4 now so I'm buying. It is possible that NAB may be forced to cut the dividend but if nothing else the outlook for NAB isn't to increase its dividend in the foreseeable future but let's face it, it's a great divvy, nothing to scoff at. Hopefully they can find a safe way to maintain the status quo and not cut. When you compare the "forecast" earnings growth for ANZ, if accurate, looks pretty impressive. To me it looks like ANZ has plenty of room to increase its dividend but then again with the housing market correction and possible future fallout, the R/C results, a big increase to the dividend wouldn't be a good look or prudent financial management but they may at least begin increasing dividends. It seems to be a watch and see game currently and a share buyback certainly isn't hurting the price of ANZ. Personally I like both banks, in fact I like all banks! Cheers
