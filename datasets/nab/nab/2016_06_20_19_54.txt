2016-06-20T19:54:00+10:00 : Brexit vote.. The upside is no Brexit but global concerns of growth will step up to fill the gap once the jubilation of the remain vote prevails. The downside is markets take a bath until they realise that the UK leaving the EU means stuff all to us. Australian shares will only ride the wave of positivity or negativity until it's yesterday's news. What's the most important thing to bank shares in Aus is the dividend cycle. It's trading until then. Just like what's happening now. Have a nice profit? Then IMO take it. The div cycle is a long way off. Everything up until the last div pump is just an opportunity to trade.
