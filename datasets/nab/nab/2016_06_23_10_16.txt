2016-06-23T10:16:00+10:00 : I'll be sitting out. It's gambling right now. I'm still on the remain side and if that happens then should be a bit of a rally. Downside is if it goes the other way the negative will be far greater than the positive. So it's not a gamble I'm prepared to take when the downside is far greater than the upside. I'll sit and watch. Still holding Boq and GXY so not completely out of the game
