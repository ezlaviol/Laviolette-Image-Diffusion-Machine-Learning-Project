If anybody knew what the market was doing then those people would either be rich or in goal. Market makers can take a stock price where they want. I like to watch for attractive prices regardless of what I think might happen. I never go all in. There will always be opportunities in the future to buy solid stocks at bargain prices. That's where they money is.
