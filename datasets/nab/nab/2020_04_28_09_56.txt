You've essentially got a free option over NAB shares, giving you the ability to buy the shares at no more than $14.15 per share. If, come 22 May which is the SPP closing date, NAB shares are a lot higher than $14.15, you can buy NAB at $14.15 via the SPP then turf them immediately after for quick profit. It's a short term arbitrage opportunity, and you can immediately re-adjust your portfolio to reflect the desired weighting of bank shares after you sell. Only caveat is that it wouldn't be worthwhile if you've only a token holding in NAB, because if a scaleback occurs then you probably won't get anywhere near the number of shares you applied for. But if  you've got a significant holding, I don't see why you wouldn't wait until closer to SPP close date before deciding whether or not to participate in the SPP.
