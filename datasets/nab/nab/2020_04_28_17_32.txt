2020-04-28T17:32:00+10:00 : the most interesting with all this is that so many claimed, before coronavirus, to have bought the banks during the GFC (when the banks were ten times worse off) but now everyone is literally so scared they not only don’t buy, but they sell! At the bottom! can’t believe I actually thought people did have the guts to buy during the gfc, so obvious now why the price was so low then... Just like it is now. Well anyhow - I say - BUY the banks. They will be around for longer than us and NAB will grow grand and great with this CEO at the steering, the company just need time, and more investors need patience, for sure. This around us, corona, recession, speculations about bad debt and so on... is nothing but another 8-12 months of noise.
