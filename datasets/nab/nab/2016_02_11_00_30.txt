2016-02-11T00:30:00+11:00 : Naive? Interesting that the CBA share price can be so robust leading into the divvy Ex Date... However anyone who can remember (or cares to check the chart) will know that when the NAB divvy was imminent we saw red just about every day leading up to the Ex Date.

She was around $30 at that time and here we are holding our stock plus the juicy 98c divvy and/or our DRP shares now valued around $24 she has gapped down around 20% in fairly short time after paying a 3% divvy... I'm simply seeing what Mr Market is telling me - NAB continues to be a dud when you line it up against CBA and to sink more money into a NAB position in the hope that this trend somehow reverses itself is futile.

Stop making excuses for NAB in comparison to the stronger performing banks, "It's the divvy, it's the de-merger, it's the summer solstice..." She has simply been sub-standard and continues to be so.
