2020-05-25T20:38:00+10:00 : In contrast, I expect to see significant scaleback. Do the maths: if only 50 per cent of retail shareholders - 285000 of 570000 - wanted an average of just $10000 in new shares, that'd be a huge amount above A$500 million.  Directors can and may increase the SPP size but perhaps not to $5 ort $10 billion.  Maybe everyone will receive $5000 in new shares and after that scalebacks, or even capped at that.  We'll know on Wednesday 27 May, probably at around 0830 hours.
