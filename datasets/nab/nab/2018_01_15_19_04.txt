2018-01-15T19:04:00+11:00 : Boredom sure is dangerous. When I get bored I head for a corner and repeat to myself over and over again "An idle mind is the devil's workshop". Otherwise my capital suffers when boredom takes over. 

Unless it drops below the support at around 29.41 (here's hoping) this month I don't see this going below 29 for a while. It's SP will be bolstered by CBA as it heads towards it's dividend in February, and traditionally, apart from January, the first months of the year going to its dividend are green for NAB. There could always be a general market correction but I don't see that happening in the next 6 months, as everyone is having too much of a good time. 

Of course now that I have said this, Mrs Market will drop it's SP like a stone to make a mockery of me. Well go ahead and do that Mrs Market, I dare you .
