2019-02-07T19:54:00+11:00 : People lose their homesÂ ? ? Well Well : Greedy people go on property buying rampage, buying one property after another, leveraging against one another :: Fact is No body forced them to do it. Greed got out of hand...If they loose their house (due to falling price), I have no sympathy, none what so ever. Same way if I loose money as a investor, does any body will ever show sympathy ? No. Why should they.
