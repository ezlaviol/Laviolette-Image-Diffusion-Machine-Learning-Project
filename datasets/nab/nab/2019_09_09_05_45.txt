2019-09-09T05:45:00+10:00 : I think you have misread what we have been contributing Gillysrooms - it isn't that we are optimists completely blind to the overall economic environment - it is just that being severely pessimistic makes little sense and predicting the downfall of financial institutions without knowing how they actually work is even less so.Credit raising happens from time to time for all commercial organisations but banks tend to raise capital in a number of ways - and credit raising is the least used method. You may want to do some research on that and this may reduce some of your concerns.The issues you have raised have been dealt with - pe981 has offered some very knowledgeable and detailed replies. I suspect any exposure to financing short term lenders is not material to overall operations for example.Any HC forum welcomes (or should) different opinions - and in recent days these have been discussed in a civil manner. So, if you are thinking that yours are being ridiculed - you are mistaken.

Well thanks for that long opinion piece too.The banks will survive and also by having rolling Cash Raisings is my prediction. I read somewhere Westpac is going to have one soon and these cash raishings must have a dilution effect and dividends must be reduced at some stage I'd imagine across all banks. And sure these are my predictions only,the predictions of one person out of millions reading HC posts, but you should be pleased to have this one opinion to read from an old out of date codger like me to raise issues no one else will dare raise because they worried about what the majority might think. This HC site is a discussion site and I hope they let me post something I've posted on other sites about the snowflakes at BHP Lol I'll leave NAB now to you optimists.
