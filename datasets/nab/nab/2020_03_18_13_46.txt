2020-03-18T13:46:00+11:00 : I know people who are showing all the symptoms and are being turned away from emergency wards from getting tested because a) they have not travelled overseas recently b) do not know any one has the virus i.e. they do not "qualify" for a test. The symptoms of COVID-19 and the common cold or influenza are very similar, to the point I will frankly admit, I do not know if they are any different at all.

They just don't have enough test kits. They are not going to get this under control by telling "unqualified" sick people to bugger off. That one case in the NAB building is a miniscule tip of the iceberg. There are probably some/many cases not being caught because of insufficient testing.
