What I am wondering about is trading the cyb on the asx exactly the same share as listed in the lse. Like a dual listing. Or are the cyb only tradable for a period of time and then you own the cybg shares and need to trade them via international markets. I'll look at it when I get home but I'm on a quick break and hope one of you guys can give me an explain like I'm 5 answer.
