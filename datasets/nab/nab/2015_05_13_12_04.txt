You don't get a capital raising just for the fun of it. If that was the case, then every company listed would be asking for cash injections on a regular basis. That way no one goes out of business. Not just the too big to fail. If you are failing because of bad management, then you should fail. Pumping liquidity into a financially bad managed businesses and keeping them propped up. Has never worked and never will. You just prolong the inevitable.
