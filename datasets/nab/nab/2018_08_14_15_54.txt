Some of the media have suggested that the NAB management have been acting in the interests of the shareholders ,they have been acting in their own self interest .The share price is where it was 8 or 9 years ago,the DIV has hardly moved so that has not been good for shareholders.The shareholders,the Bank,the staff and the customers have been poorly served by bad management.
