Holders talking about a run to $40 were dreaming. Not that it can't happen, but it can't happen in a straight line so we will so lots of peaks & troughs on the way there.

So... watch the price, buy (accumulate) at prices towards 12 month lows and use your DRP to compound the yield over the next 10 yrs.
