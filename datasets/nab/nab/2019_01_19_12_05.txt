2019-01-19T12:05:00+11:00 : Current FF dividend is about 11.3%, it is good to see the same people that thought NAB was overpriced when the FF div was over 12% are still talking wait and see.

As I stated a month or more ago, all the talk nearly 4 years ago was about how bullish people were on the big banks. They have declined ever since with NAB falling from just under $40 to the$22.50 low recently.

I decided to go a bit further back in history, back to when NAB first hit $24-$25/sh in early 1999. The dividend for 1998 had been 49c first half FF and 53c second half 79% FF. (This is from ASX announcements that you can still go to). Total dividend was $1.02/sh for the year.

Here we are 20 years later, the business still has its ups and downs, yet the FF dividend is almost double what it was 20 years ago, but this is not good enough for some, despite the minor detail of interest earned in bank accounts being less than half of 1999 rates.

For me they can cut the dividend by a bit, the share price can stay at these levels for a long time, I wont care as paying me a 12 %, 10% or even 8% FF div is fine by me. I think my personal wish is that the SP does not take off to into the $30's because then I would get tempted to take the cap gain!!

One aspect about all the banks that has happened for decades. They make some good decisions and they make some poor ones, but keep on pumping out good dividends as the base business is rock solid IMHO.

Anyone expecting collapse in the banks, is expecting it for the entire economy, IMHO your money wont be safe anywhere is such conditions!! I just can't see that happening as our population continues to grow.

I can only wish that people are stupid enough to sell this down to below $20/sh, so I can buy a lot more!!
