Pay off whatever debt you have, and do it as quickly as possible because that is the only way forward once we stop kicking the can down the road, but that is a Macroeconomic function that will occur in due course.Bank branches will always be a necessary part of the eco system, but I agree one in each suburb isn't required.  Most people have at least one bank account.  usually more.  Need to buy a house?  You arent going to Afterpay or Zip to get a 300k loan to purchase a property.  You might go to a credit union, or even a smaller financial institution, but the big 4 are generally where its at.Dodgy super insurance and investment schemes...  The big 4 dont have too much dodgy behaviour about them.  Anitquated, but generally underpinned by regulation unlike some of the bubbles I see forming in economic markets.The big question is, why do you believe, with so much conviction that the statements you are making, are accurate?  What reading of the tea leaves do you have access to, that makes you so sure that your statements of fact are indeed going to come to fruition?  I can point to similar economic downturns in history to see what the most likely path to recovery looks like, and IMHO the current status quo points to the banks having economic recovery sooner or later, and being the blue chip defensive investment that you state they are not.Even in the current climate, theyre showing resilience.  There might even be a bit of economic storm on the horizon for them, but IMHO, they will weather it quite well, and come out the other side and be exactly what they were pre pandemic.
