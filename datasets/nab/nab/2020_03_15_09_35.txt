2020-03-15T09:35:00+11:00 : I don't think we will see a 50% cut to dividends. The next dividend may drop a bit (but only maybe as NAB has already pushed down the percentage of what it pays in dividends) Even a cut down into the range of 75-80 cents for the half year still makes the yield well over over 10%.I will add that I am very bullish with NAB at the moment so maybe some bias. Buying up as much as I can (unfortunately with very limited funds at the moment). $20 and under and NAB has become an incredible opportunity.

At Friday's NAB closing price, if NAB is to cut their dividend by 50% based on last year's payout of $1.66 to $0.83 cts, their yield will be 4.5% or with franking credits/gross 6.44%.  Current Term/fixed deposit rates is ~1.6% and forecast to be less going forward......
