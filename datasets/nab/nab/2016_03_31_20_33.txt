2016-03-31T20:33:00+11:00 : Thankyou mate, so with NAB if im sitting at say $24.00 a share and i want to buy 1000 more tomorrow for a quick day trade, if i buy 1000 more in the morning and sell them off by the end of the day for a quick profit but still keep my remaining shares i brought at $24.00 it will altar my current 24.00 share price and make it higher.   Doesn't that mean I lose out when I sell the thousand shares and keep my current shares i brought for 24.00 ?

Sorry just trying to get my head around all this.  I want to keep my current shares i brought at 24.00  but also buy some more in the morning to sell off in the afternoon for a quick profit.  

 Hope this makes sense what I'm trying to put in words. 

Regards
Darren
