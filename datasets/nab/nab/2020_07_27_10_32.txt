2020-07-27T10:32:00+10:00 : Great input, and cannot say I disagree with you, for one second.Personally (disclosure: not a home owner yet) I feel with the levels of household debt, and ever increasing economic strain we are experiencingit should be almost a given that it is largely over-capitalised and be very exposed? Is that a fair enough call? Happy to be corrected..My income has gone down approx 35% and I can't say I feel great, but I do believe there will be a significant bounce-back in the years to come.In the overall scheme of things, think we have incredibly lucky so far... compared to numerous countries.Not by any means trying to be right, as I'm not a property analyst, or economist.. just growing increasingly weary, and suspect of the countless articles both the REA and mainstream media keep publishing regarding how defiant the property market is, and this worries me. The other thing too, as I've said earlier I don't take any joy in the likelihood of this occurring, as it will hurt a lot of people.Look forward to your reply.
