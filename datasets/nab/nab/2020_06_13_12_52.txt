2020-06-13T12:52:00+10:00 : I am working on it. Sold and Bought some units during last few days. More in process.  I am doing same for all my holdings. ...Selling at 19 and buying at 15 ? If it was that easy I can assure you everybody will do it....Keeping Track Record of what was held  in which year and what was sold is a nightmare. Then one need to keep record of Tax Rate in Each Year. It is an Accounting Nightmare...I love to keep Tax Return simple even if there is massive losses brought forward.
