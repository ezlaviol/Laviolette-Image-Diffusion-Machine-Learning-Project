Biggest worry is..1)  Too many small business going belly up (going down). NAB is Australia largest business lender, chances of massive write down are there..2) What happened to UK Banks will likely happen to Aussie Banks and banks will go in long term low or negative growth territory..3) Economy will bring lot of pain to housing market. Low interest rates may cushion the effect but How Long ?..4) Better to sit on fence for few months and wait-wait-wait.
