2020-05-30T14:20:00+10:00 : dow jones banks took another hit overnight. NAB may well close on Monday with a $16 in front of it.  And I suspect that when the SPP is released we will be in the $15's and I will probably be a buyer. And as long as Nab pays dividends during this economic crisis the stock will hover around this mark.You just cant expect to have capital growth AND yield atmo.
