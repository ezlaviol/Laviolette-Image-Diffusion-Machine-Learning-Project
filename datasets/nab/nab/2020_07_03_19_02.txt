I actually use SelfWealth to do all my trades but kept my CommSec account for the live pricing and the research that is done through there (Selfwealth portfolio view and overview is 20 minute delayed and there is not a whole lot of research that is free). Its pretty basic which can be a negative for some people and you cant integrate it with share sight if you use that (you have to manually email through your trades)  but besides those little gripes i dont mind it at all. I think they have a new Mobile app/Website coming out soon so some of these features may be fixed sometime in the future.
