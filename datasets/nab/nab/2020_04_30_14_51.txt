ANZ around the GFC had a SPP that they did not scale back though. I think that was well in the money, circa 15% and going up, so perhaps there is some hope NAB don't scale back this too much, hard to say.Of course who knows if it will be "in the money" much in a few weeks from now though anyway. Potentially the over subscriptions could be a lot more with the $30k rule now.
