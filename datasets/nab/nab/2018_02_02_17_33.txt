2018-02-02T17:33:00+11:00 : Even at $30 itâ€™s still an unbelievable buy.

My target is $31 by end of March. My buyin is average of $29.96 so I may be biased

On a serious, bloody good buy at the moment - sound business, quality dividend, cheapest of all banks based on fundamentals and the list goes on.
