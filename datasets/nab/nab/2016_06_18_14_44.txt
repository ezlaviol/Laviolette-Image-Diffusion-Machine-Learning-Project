2016-06-18T14:44:00+10:00 : The full year result comes out in late October and they go ex-div 4 November 2016.  Where are you getting the September 1st date from? 

The div may be lowered but they have around $450m in excess franking (as I understand it) so it seems likely they will try to keep the higher payout ratio if possible.
