2018-05-17T10:34:00+10:00 : I'll be looking to take a position shortly - ideally off the back of a down day on the US markets, which all things being equal would normally add a bit of extra selling pressure. That gap to ANZ has now increased to around 2%, plus the extra yield of 1.6% on offer via NAB's dividends at this moment (that is, if it can maintain them, because there is some doubt there). If that buffer grows out to around 4-5%, I'll feel comfortable rolling over from ANZ, since I'm fully invested and can only buy from sale proceeds.
