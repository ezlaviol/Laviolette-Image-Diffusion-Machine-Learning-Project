I thought it would be a bit more subdued but cashed up funds buying after the sell off doing wonders for a lot of sectors. I'll steer of clear of buying after such a big rally and wait for some of the profit taking to start. No fomo here. The missing out already happened a few days ago. BOQ was my only good buy so I'm sitting just above yr average now. I'm looking at August when the CBA makes their announcement to start averaging in or sooner if we have another event of some sort. The profit taking after this big rally should give an indication how nervous the investors are. A small pullback might be an indicator that the markets expect a decent push forward yet from here. Two or three days down in a row is more likely to be profits being banked while they exist. That might get me picking up an early parcel for a start in the next leg up.
