2021-04-19T14:38:00+10:00 : Hi Hobbit,With two & half weeks to go to the release date, I'm more interested now in the impending dividend.My tip is 75 cents fully franked - this is based on the previous 83 cents (paid in 2019) reduced to account for the extra shares issued in 2020.Incidently you posted;"In FY19, NAB paid dividends totalling 186c â€“ two dividends of 83c each. In FY20, NAB paid two dividends of 30c each, the final on the enlarged share base."Not sure if this was your work or cut & pasted, but 83 cents X 2 = $1.66, not $1.86
