2017-12-13T00:29:00+11:00 : With housing market clearly tightening in Sydney especially, banks need to grow business & revenues in other areas.

The first bank to take blockchain by The balls, spin off a 'crypto bank' and start actually dealing in things like Bitcoin will go ofd like a firecracker.

Imagine if NABtrade came up with a way for punters to trade crypto on their platform?

This is the next big money move by a major bank. Too risky for the big four perhaps?
