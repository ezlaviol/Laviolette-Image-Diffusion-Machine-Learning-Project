Just a quick post:-

Regarding all the adverse publicity (Media) re the many questionable loans that were written I ask-

- Would the people who signed the loan applications -stating that information supplied is correct-when it wasn't be 
   liable for  supplying false information?
-With all the  written privacy 'cr-p' laws  wouldn't  it be hard/challenging  for Banks to verify clients' information.

   (seems the 'privacy nonsence ' -Facebook etc etc etc proves its a problem in itself ???)

Just interested in comments !

Keep safe all Nab'ers

All IMHO  and please DYOR............  then if you make a mistake you will know instantly to whom you point the finger. (Just a suggestion.) This will save a heap of disappointment, sorrow and sleepless nights trying to find who to blame.. The person in the mirror!!!
