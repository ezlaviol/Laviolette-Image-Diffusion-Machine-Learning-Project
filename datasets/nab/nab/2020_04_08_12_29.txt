The thing that concerns me is that the banks no longer appear to be allowed to operate in a free market economy.
Yes the banks have screwed up in the past and abused their market power but now we have gone from one extreme to the other.
The banks are now told when they can and can't pay a dividend, they are told to pass all the RBA interest rate cuts onto mortgage holders even though this then affects pensioners who live off their term deposit interest and there are now multiple other things such as fees and charges that are now being dictated by the government.

They are no longer operating in a free market economy so to be honest the government may as well  nationalize the 4 big banks and just have one big bank controlled by two people (the PM and Treasurer) as this is just about whats happening now anyway.
