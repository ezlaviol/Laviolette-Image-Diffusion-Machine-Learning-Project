By no common sense paying $10 per share by NAB is capital management as it is called looting what belongs to shareholders ... as they could have given that to shareholders by dividend instead of paying $10 per share in buyback and $10 is based on this week's price if this guys buy at $32 then it will be $18 per share.... ... !
