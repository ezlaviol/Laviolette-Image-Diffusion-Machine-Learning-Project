2018-02-23T09:14:00+11:00 : Hi everyone,
I want to start a new thread for serious candlestick investors/ traders so we can share information regarding buy/ sell candlestick signals/ patterns.
For example, I bought NAB very recently after seeing a strong bullish engulfing pattern. 
I would love to hear from like minded individuals so we can share info to our mutual benefit.
Having read with disgust many posts that are personal/ ramping etc and a complete waste of time I will restate I am only interested in serious candlestick investors who present facts and patterns that can benefit us all.
Look forward to hearing from you,
Mikey
