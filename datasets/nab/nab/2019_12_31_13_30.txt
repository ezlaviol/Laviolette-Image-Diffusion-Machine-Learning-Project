2019-12-31T13:30:00+11:00 : And I forgot to mention State Bank Of NSW through its Colonial Mutual takeover, it got a very good and stable residential and commercial residential through the old State Bank of NSW that Colonial purchased prior to its takeover.NAB never really got a good takeover done save for Bank of New Zealand which NAB got as a result of Piggy Muldoon’s protectionism (which Ardern and Peters are now trying to replicate). Under the Lange Government, NAB got the only really good bank in NZ which had the Auckland Bible Belt long before all the mainland capital leaked out of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. So BNZ is really strong in NAB but NAB has always struggled in residential in Australia and mainly goes after the business and commercial portfolios historically of course. Westpac absolutely nailed it in Australia with St George (incorporating Advance Bank). ANZ went offshore to purchase and buy Outside Equity Interests in everything. Something that the new accountant guy from Citibank, Shane Elliott’s now unwinding. All IMHO pls DYODD.and on your other point, ROE provides a ballast not a determinant. WBC is mainly lost in terms of SP due to scandals.
