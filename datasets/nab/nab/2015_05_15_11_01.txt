2015-05-15T11:01:00+10:00 : In all the years (16) I've held NAB they only did one CR (a SPP in '09, just after the GFC).  Where are all these cash injections you are talking about, tetetetetetete?  In that time, my IRR has been about 10%, not stellar, but steady, just as a blue chip should be.  You have absolutely zero credibility.  My only reason for reading you is that I assume you are just a stirrer with a sense of irony.  Let me know otherwise.
