Next week could be a boomer for NAB - definitely over $20 on Tuesday and possibly up 10% by the end of next week.800 point rise on he DOW points to a better than expected economic revival - that should flow through to the ASX.

its been a great week for banks all round.  Bank of America up another 5% overnight - imo a positive sign for Aus banks next week .
