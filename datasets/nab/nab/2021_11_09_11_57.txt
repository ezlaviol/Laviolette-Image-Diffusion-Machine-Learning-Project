I took them up and got all of the $30k they were offering for shareholders at the time and have included all our Nab holding into the DRP since then. I dont think over the long term they will perform as well as MQG, CBA, and ANZ but the price it was going for last year was to good not to take up. They have done pretty well since then and with the share buy back and increased profits I see better and higher dividends down the track.Who is going to complain with their SP and dividends returns since March last year. Lets see the dividend returns and the SP gains over 2022 in comparison to the other banks. I am sure most of us are also holding shares in at least 2 of the over major Australian banks and maybe some MQG to boot. Its one share of most peoples balanced portfolio and its pulled its weight and been a great performer over the last 20 months.
