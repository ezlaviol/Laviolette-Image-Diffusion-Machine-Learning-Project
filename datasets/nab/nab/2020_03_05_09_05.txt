Baird, a former premier of New South Wales, left politics in 2017 to join NAB, leading the corporate and institutional bank division, before taking on the consumer banking role in late 2018. 	Australia's third-largest lender did not specify any reason for Baird's departure, which comes three months after CEO Ross McEwan began his tenure after a powerful inquiry into industry misconduct criticised top management, leading to the exit of former CEO Andrew Thorburn. 	Baird, 51, was seen as a favourite by analysts for the chief executive role.
