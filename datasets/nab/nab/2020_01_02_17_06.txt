"revision to the mean" is what your counting on. so your holding time to really make money should be 3-5 years. thats where the rubber hits the road, if you can come to a decision based on the current situation of the company and stick to the decision and not be swayed by what you read, or by .02c earnings upgrades or downgrades , can control the  animal urges an just sit tight, you'll do ok. too hard to win the short game at shares, not many play the long game these day's.
