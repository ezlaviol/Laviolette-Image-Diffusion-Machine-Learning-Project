2017-05-17T13:12:00+10:00 : this weeks media has brought  to attention  the problem  of the'' new'' tax ,,what  it means and how to manage  it .... the biggest  danger  is the potential  to increase  it where ever and  by what  ever.in the  future ,,this will be  seen as a cash  cow  in  the  future ,, if it is a one  off it is   manageable =====  if it  $6.2 billion  and comes off top line..[gross earnings ] then with  company  tax  of 30%  reduces  by  $1.86 billion,,,,, bad  but  not that  bad ,,this  is''' not'' portrayed  by  both  sides ..but as we know  once  up and running its here to stay , but with  near certain chance  of being  increased as needed  ,,as the media  hates  banks , also banks which  I hold shares  in.. 2   have not  been good corporate businesses  .. any thoughts
