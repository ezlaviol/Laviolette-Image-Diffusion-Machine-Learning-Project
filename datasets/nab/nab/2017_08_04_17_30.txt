Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) fell over 4 percent before finishing down 3.9 percent, marking its biggest intraday fall in over a year, after financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC initiated civil penalty proceedings, accusing the bank of 53,700 breaches, in the biggest case of the kind against a major bank.
