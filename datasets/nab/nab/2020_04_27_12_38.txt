2020-04-27T12:38:00+10:00 : of course... we’ve had a market crash and these are the stocks that actually move the index. All depends on the timeframe you look at... I could brag about buying BHP in 2016 and doubling my money... yet if you bought 6 years ago you’re in losses. Your chart also doesn’t factor in accumulation index which puts in dividends.I could show you a list of over hyped small/mid caps that are now 0 or -90% over xyz period. I have different investment style. I’m not after high risk multi bagging small caps that often end in years. I wouldn’t sleep at night putting $100ks into high risk stocks. Good luck to you if you do and come around ahead of the benchmark. Most don’t.
