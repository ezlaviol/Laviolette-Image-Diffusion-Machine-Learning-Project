I would be confident of getting a chance to sell some NAB well over $30 within the next 6-12 months so simply hold & collect some dividends over that time.

I think the critical thing for you now is to plan - where do you think you might put that capital? NAB is a good defensive stock with very good yield, so it would seem important to me that the capital goes into a solid company within a growth sector rather than randomly chasing faster gains.
