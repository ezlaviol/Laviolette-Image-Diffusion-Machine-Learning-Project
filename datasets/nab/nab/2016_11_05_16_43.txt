2016-11-05T16:43:00+11:00 : IMO I don't think NAB is underperforming. All the banks are in a similar position. The US election or the fear that trump will be elected has hit the financials hard.  If Clinton wins IMO world markets will rebound overnight.

I think NAB will have a good year provided Clinton is elected. 

Cant beat the Aussie banks just keep the dividends rolling in.   Clinton gets over the line its 30+
