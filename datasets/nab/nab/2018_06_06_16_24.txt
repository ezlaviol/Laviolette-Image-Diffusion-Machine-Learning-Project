I also wouldn't assume NAB is not guilty of money laundering because it's possible that all four big banks are. Although they might not all get prosecuted.

On another note, CBA was down 1.65% today which carves a whopping $2 billion from their market cap in one session.

The banks aren't out of the woods yet.
