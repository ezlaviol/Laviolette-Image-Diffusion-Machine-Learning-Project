2020-05-26T10:39:00+10:00 : Quick question. I'm in uni and only just starting in investing. I only owned a small parcel of shares prior to the SPP and have put in almost 10x the value of my holding into the SPP. I'm obviously hoping it gets filled entirely but wanted to understand how the scaleback might work for a small investor like myself. Say for instance $2 billion is raised and they do end up scaling back to $500 million, how many shares would I likely receive if I have placed a $10 000 order? Do the number of shares I owned prior impact this or is scaled based on the amount of money sent through? Thanks for the clarification as this is all still very new to me Note: I am aware it's at NAB's discretion as to if or how a scale back may occur, but was wondering what exactly might occur if they do a pro rata share holding scale back...
