So long as investors don't swap over to oil companies after the Saudi oil production being cut in half - whick may have led to the sell off in banks today.Yes, it looks rosy for banks at the moment.

I was expecting massive swapping today(Oil for Banks), but recovery was as fast as drop. Few panic selling then quick recovery. Also CSL was badly hit then recovered all losses...Few weak stocks took the hit.
