Earlier generations had it much tougher, not denying.

Maybe you had  better start, than myself.

My grandparents lived in their own house, but without any comfort.

Imagine Europe's winter with no inside toilet/bathroom, not even running water in the house, memories of sleeping on flee infested straw beds still haunts me.

My parents were a bit more comfortable, yet still very-very poor even though they worked hard!
Some of us  we managed to build up some wealth, hoping for a much better life for our kids, than we had.

I have enough to live my life comfortably, but  I still wish my kids (hard working people) have an even better life, than mine!
