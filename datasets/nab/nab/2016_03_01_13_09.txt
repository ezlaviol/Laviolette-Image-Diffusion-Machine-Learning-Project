There was talk of an effort being made by some organizations to push the price down and using fear tactics of housing market collapse etc. Like I said I can't remember who the guest was but the sentiment was at this time there was no indication of anything collapsing. Just the fear injected into the market. It was mentioned that of course it's possible in the future that housing prices may suffer along with the economy in general I guess. Personally I've picked up a couple of small parcels yesterday and today close to $24. There does seem to be some very decent support at that level. If it dips into $23 I'll pick up a few more. Just waiting on Westpac to drop so I can grab some of those bit WBC is a stubborn ship it seems.
