I did sell most of my NAB shares at $29.02 - and in that event, missed out on the next dividend. Can't say I am not happy I did that - though it now means that I can buy back in when the SP starts to stabilise.This is just plain ridiculous. I can only imagine that investors are factoring in another rate cut as well as a further deterioration in future profits.Good luck to us all.

Think we should see some recovery in the SP today - good leads from Fridays trade overseas and I suspect that NAB got oversold last week post dividend.
