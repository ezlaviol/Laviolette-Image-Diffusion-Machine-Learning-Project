2013-05-20T10:37:00+10:00 : Hello to all,PPP charged my credit card in March without letting me know - they say it's in the contract, sure when you are signing up there is not other way then tick "yes" to be charged in 12 months but you should be informed before that occurs. They say they send me a card by mail ( I do not understand why not an email) before they charged me, I did not received anything from them not even an invoice after they charged me!I just call them and all they do is argue jump in when you talk and are pretty sharp on the phone - feels like they have had this conversation before.I HAVE LOST A LOT OF MONEY THANKS TO PPP AND THANKS TO THE PRESSURE THEY PUT ON THEIR CUSTOMERS THEY LOST ME FOR GOOD!THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU SIGN UP WITH THIS COMPANY!
