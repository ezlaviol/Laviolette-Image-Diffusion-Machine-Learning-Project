2018-11-08T21:24:00+11:00 : I thought it was a disappointing actually.  We had a very strong lead from Wall St which resulted in the other major bank stocks being up between 1.8 and 2.2 percent.  If NAB had kept pace it would be somewhere in the vicinity of (25.87 (yesterdays close) - .99) 8 (1 + 0.018) = $25.32. I guess there were people holding to get the dividend and selling today. If that is correct then maybe NAB will outperform the other bank shares over the next few days. All IMO and DYOR.
