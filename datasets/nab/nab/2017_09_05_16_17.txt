How far will NAB drop ? I think this depends on how long you are willing to wait,.. look at the other threads in this NAB Topic,... lots of deliberations on this. Abt a few weeks ago before all the CBA news came abt, many were waiting at $27, if my memory serves me right.

Looking at the landscape of the banking industry,.. I'd buy BOTH when the value comes,... I think something will hit NAB soon,...
