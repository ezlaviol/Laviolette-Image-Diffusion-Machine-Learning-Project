Nasty day for the asx. I'm more interested in focused targets rather than when the whole market is getting hammered. Those nice days when some bad news floats by. Interesting to see how much of the dip gets clawed back tomorrow and where it finishes at close. A positive us fed response might be good for the Dow and us to follow for a run. But, then it might not. Who knows! Not me
