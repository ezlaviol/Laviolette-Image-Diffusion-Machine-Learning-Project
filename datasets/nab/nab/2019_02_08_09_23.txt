It was all about the Royal Commission banking report not being as bad as expected and the huge windfall the banks will get by not having to pay mortgage broker commission.

Nab didn't rally as much as the other 3 due to the chair and the ceo quite rightly getting slammed for their poor performance at the hearing.
With both now going Nab should out perform the other 3 banks as long as they appoint decent replacements to turn the bank around.
