Funding 6% p.a for 5 years will have eaten up 30% of you capital base and once its gone its gone.With the div you get your 8% + tax credits + the prospect of your capital going up or down over time. A much better prospect than eroding a capital base to meet a desired funding target.Risk reward, you can't have your cake and eat it too unfortunately
