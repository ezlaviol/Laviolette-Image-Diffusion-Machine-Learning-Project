It is the tellers that are the endangered species in bank branches.I am in that are group that, while embracing on-line banking, did not trust the "hole in the wall" until about three years ago - reluctantly.Branches will continue to decline in number - though they will never entirely disappear. The cashless society is coming and that will spell the end to the need for tellers (as well as ATMS perversely and cash handling security companies as well). Imagine the insurance that banks would save by not dealing with cash.

In November I was speaking to a lady in SA who works for ANZ in a country branch.She said they now have only one client who puts cash in and takes cash out via a teller and refuses a card of any sort (very eccentric, apparently) and therefore won't use an autoteller either. Everyone else has a card and uses the autoteller except for 2, who prefer to bank with a person, but have cards and will take out cash from the machine if they need to.So I guess the writing's on the wall there. For that branch, anyway. I can't see it continuing to operate for very much longer.Wonder what happens to the odd guy?A bit like my sister...she still transfers money by cheque (!) LOL
