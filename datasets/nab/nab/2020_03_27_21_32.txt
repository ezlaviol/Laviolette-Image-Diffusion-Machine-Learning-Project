At that time NAB was trading $30/Share (That was more than 6 month back)..My simple question is : Why Westpac Bank did capital raising few months back ? (because Distress Properties List Piling Up )..Since then things has changed drastically and gone downhill like a Tornado. Forget Dividend, Banks will be bleeding with Write offs and Foreclosures now and may be forced to do Re-Capitalise. Although Aussie banks are healthy, but all that is changing on daily basis...That is what I calls History Repeat Itself. ..2008 GFC started, by Sept 2009 bankruptcies and foreclosure forced lots of banks to recapitalise....We are still months away before ASX and Banks hit the Bottom...
