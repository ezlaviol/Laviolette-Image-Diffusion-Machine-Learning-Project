You are the one that says they bought into NAB because of the buy back and are not happy with the return since buying
But now you are saying you are not happy because NAB hasn't told you something? Is that it?
Seriously, my point was, expecting a significant short term SP rise because of that buy back didn't make sense. Simple arithmetic, simple logic! Is that simple enough?????
