What we will never know is what else will be thrown up in the  AUSTRACK enquiry, The ride up in SP values for NAB could still have to negotiate a bumpy road.Keep in mind that a few weeks back NAB hit $29.92. The fall in the SP (while affected by the US-China trade fiasco) was largely down to other bank failings. Seems logical, if the worst is basically known, that the SP should recover by the end of the year - maybe even strongly with a few hiccups along the way.

      Will be interesting to see where the next swing high occurs      presuming the  low of $26 holds in the short term.      My guess is we may get a bounce back up to about $28      to compete the next wave.      What are your thoughts guys and girls ?
