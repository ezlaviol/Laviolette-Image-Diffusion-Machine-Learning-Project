2015-10-29T16:36:00+11:00 : Got slaughtered today, shorters have had a field  day last two days.

No brainier IMO at this level leading up to 99c divi cut off next Thursday.

Good AGM yesterday, new dynamic management team continuing to clean up the mess from the past,  in a very open and transparent way. Well done.

They certainly are a breath of fresh air and look for a strong performance next year.
