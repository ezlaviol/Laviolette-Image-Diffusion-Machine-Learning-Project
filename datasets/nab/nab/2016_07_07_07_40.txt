2016-07-07T07:40:00+10:00 : With the result of the election likely to firm today - my prediction 77 LNP seats - no Royal Commission, green US bank o/night and green ASX futures there could be a bit of short covering today.

PS- there's still a couple of seats too close to call but majority is 76 and I think they'll get at least that.
