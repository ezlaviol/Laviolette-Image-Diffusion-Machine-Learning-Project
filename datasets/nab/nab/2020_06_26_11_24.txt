If you hadn't margin loaned, you would've held and likely made sizable profits in the long term.In a similar vein, expecting history to repeat itself exactly in a completely different scenario is just as foolish. Imo, NAB at these prices provides suitable opportunities for long term exposure to growth in the Aus economy and sp gains. If you don't have the patience, or capital to watch gains and declines in the short term to reach that, then you shouldn't be investing in this stock.
