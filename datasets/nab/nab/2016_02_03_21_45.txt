2016-02-03T21:45:00+11:00 : You're comparing a day (today) when NAB went ex-bonus issue (XB) with a normal trading day for CBA?
C'mon man! How did they do relatively once you take into account the de-merger and add £1.80 to the SP?

Comparing the charts NAB v CBA, it looks like they separated around November but otherwise travelled together during the previous 12 months casually looking at the 1Y. What happened around that time?

NAB just separated out a loss-maker they've been carrying for ages. They're leaner and fitter than ever by comparison.  Therefore the most opportunity for improvement exists in NAB.  CBA are great, i agree but how would they do any better than they are now? For these reasons I believe the outlook is good.
