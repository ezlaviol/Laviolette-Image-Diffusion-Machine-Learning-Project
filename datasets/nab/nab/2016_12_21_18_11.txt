But wisdom in the market is understanding and excepting they will come just like death and taxes. Many holders are lured into a "bullish" mindset when a stock is rising (as NAB has for 5-6 months) and it's easy to feel confident buying a stock on the back of a nice bull run.

But my experience in general has shown this to be an error and in fact this is what Buffett's investment mantra is all about. When a stock is racing, brace for a downturn and look to buy stocks at the opposite end of the cycle.

NAB is looking great right now and I don't know about traders but for LT hold now would not be the time to buy NAB IMHO.
