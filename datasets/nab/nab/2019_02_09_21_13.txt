If 18 months is the 'time' from the top to the crash, then we would have passed it by now. Property in both Melb and Sydney has certainly come of the over inflated values, but the banks were pulling back on IO loans a couple of years ago. 

IMHO property will go sideways to slightly down for another couple of years, then sideways after that, but with current rate of migration and population growth, it is hard to see any crash.
