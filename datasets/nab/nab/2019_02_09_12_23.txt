2019-02-09T12:23:00+11:00 : Removal of imputation credits according to my calculations affects everyone who has superannuation. I only know this because my SMSF received a tax refund last year due to imputation credits. I think it is a wealth destroying policy for everyone. Most people would have no clue about their super and shrug their shoulders and go who cares.....Tax refunds into super helps all of us grow our super balance over time. This is the one Labor policy that has me very annoyed and super wary of. Effectively it takes tax benefits away from every one of us trying to build our super balance. I say if Labor is looking for money to fund promises then make big corporations pay their fair share of tax. Whilst the R/C was progressing Turnbull was attempting to punish the Big 4 with 19 billion dollars worth of tax cuts I mean seriously! WTF? Am I wrong about this guys? Is anyone else seeing what I’m seeing here? BTW I’m not a bank basher. I hold NAB, ANZ and BOQ. Now the R/C is over I expect NAB to begin its upwards trajectory. It has a solid outlook IMO.
