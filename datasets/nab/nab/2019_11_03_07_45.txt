2019-11-03T07:45:00+11:00 : MissG - this is not a bad thing that we have a different opinion so maybe no need to be that aggressive  Plus, charts can be a bit deceptive over longer periods and you would know that anyway. GFC would queer the overall trend anyway - it was a big hit and the RC would have added another negative (and temporary) hit. What we all can agree on is that in a very low interest rate environment, the banks will remain flat with profits - for as long as low interest rates remain - we could be looking at a decade.Point you have not taken into account is that banks are "income" driven.. If you are purely concentrating on capital gains, then buy spec shares. NAB dividends over the 20 years of your graph would have exceeded the SP easily.I get it though - you have a dislike for banks. Perhaps, one investor to another, you could let me know where I should park my available funds if not here in NAB.

You have pointed out a " Trade " which is exactly my point . NAB is below the price it was in 1999 high , that my friend is a buy and hold dead duck with ZERO capital gains . Stick a linear regression on 20 years of NAB  . it slopes down , i rest my case . Sure it has enough Beta to be a good trader but if you have bought this long term over that period you are underperforming the market . NAB is in a 20 year downtrend , why am i having this conversation its as clear as day and irrefutable
