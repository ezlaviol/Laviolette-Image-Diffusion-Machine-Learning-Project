The bank lifted its variable rate for owner occupiers to  5.32 percent, from 5.25 percent, and rates on residential  investment home loans to 5.80 percent, from 5.55 percent.  	"The difference between what we charge and how much it costs  us to fund a mortgage remains under pressure, with intense  competition, increasing regulation, and elevated funding costs,"  said NAB chief operating officer Antony Cahill.
