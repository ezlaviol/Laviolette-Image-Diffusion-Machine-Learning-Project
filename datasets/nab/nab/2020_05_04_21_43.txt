As for accumulating, I am not too sure at this stage.

GFC is still very much on my mind, and our world /economy could be in a lot more trouble  this time.
Just be carefull, losing money is always painful.
Sadly there is nowhere  to hide, with about zero interest rate/falling share prices combined with zero dividends.
What hope do we have?
