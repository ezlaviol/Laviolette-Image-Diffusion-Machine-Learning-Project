2020-06-16T01:52:00+10:00 : 14.91 is a good price to pay for NAB but I believe with covid there is still another 6.5 months of bank horror to come before one helll of a rally sometime next year. I am so sure of my chart reading skills that I have a little over 200k sitting on the sidelines just for nab short term trading. so far I'm 45k ahead in a month and waiting for next opportunity. it's getting close but not here yet!
