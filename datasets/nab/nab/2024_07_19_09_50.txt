2024-07-19T09:50:00+10:00 : (Updates with background throughout, adds comments from Westpac, regulator) 	   July 19 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator announced on Friday a reduction of A$500 million in the A$1 billion ($670.50 million) capital add-on it had imposed on Westpac  (WBC)  in 2019 after identifying higher operational risk in the bank's risk governance self-assessment.  	In July 2019, the country's prudential regulator had asked Westpac, ANZ Group  (ANZ)  and National Australia Bank  (NAB)  to set aside an additional A$500 million each until they strengthen their risk management and reimburse customers for wrongly charged fees. 		The regulator then  	imposed 	 an additional A$500 million capital add-on on Westpac in December 2019 to reflect the bank's heightened operational risk profile, primarily due to risk governance concerns.			In mid-March, the country's prudential regulator  	removed 	 the A$500 million imposed on NAB.	 		Westpac said the reduction will boost its common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio by 18 basis points.	  		"The remaining A$500 million capital add-on will remain in place until Westpac completes its transition work," the regulator added.				 ($1 = 1.4914 Australian dollars)
