Can anyone explain to me the purpose behind someone having these large buy and sell orders sitting on all the banks over the last few days. Exactly the same quantities for both bid and ask. NAB has 134,300 (bid @ $26.82, ask @ $27.82), ANZ HAS 166,400 Shares, WBC with 118,700 etc.The answer is probably quite obvious, but I just don't get it having seen similar orders at the close of trade for a while now. Anyone?
