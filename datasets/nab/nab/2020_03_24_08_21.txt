I notice you give no analysis to back up your prediction.There will be a natural bottom as the price SP now does not reflect the true value - and maybe not even the expected hit we will receive from the lockdowns.. If it gets below $13 then people will be rushing to buy.

I think 7 to 8 is where it’s headed, any other thoughts?
