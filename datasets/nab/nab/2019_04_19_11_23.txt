2019-04-19T11:23:00+10:00 : Well BOQ cut their dividend. NAB will cut, I suspect WBC might as well. ANZ probably ok.Fine by me. I own them all. Will top up if the market drops the majors on the first dividend cut. Banks are cheap even with the cut.Major short term risks:1. Labor victory2. Dividend cut 3. Increased bad debt provisions from housing/economic downturnAll 3 highly likely and most likely weigh down the already cheap share prices. Iâ€™ll look at topping up after the election and results in May. Might be a great buy ex dividend which will fall around the election time.
