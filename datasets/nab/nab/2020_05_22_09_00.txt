I'm less pessimistic about the finances of the 6 million workers on JobKeeper than you - I think a large number of those are not in a typically stretched financial situation that you'd expect from those on Centrelink payments. Most I'd expect have at least say $5k of liquid assets to access. I note that WBC's SPP was pitched at $25.32 or 2% of VWAP. WBC was $26.80 per share when the offer opened, but had fallen to $24.60 by the SPP closing date. So, the stag profit all but disappeared - no wonder only 7% participated!
