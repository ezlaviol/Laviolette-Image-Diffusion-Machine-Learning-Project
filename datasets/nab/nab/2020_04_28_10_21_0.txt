2020-04-28T10:21:00+10:00 : you mean my 3/4 bank stocks have been losers, they may rebound heavily after this as present value. Which is probably only 20% of total portfolio.you can’t put a large portfolio all in on high risk stocks.ill cherry pick - I’m up over 10% on SGR purchases last week!! The sky is falling you guys picked some losers as you missed it!
