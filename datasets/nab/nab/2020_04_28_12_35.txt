Nothing to do with the excessive out of control and poorly skilled immigrants, that is a furphy for NAB, it is management that got NAB to its low point.McEwan and McKeon are both New Zealanders/ Australians so they are not technically immigrants.McEwan should have either resigned or be sacked. McKeon’s appointment to the Board should be investigated and APRA should be asked to review.Perhaps we need a wholesale root and branch review of Board governance, Board appointments, compliance and external advice.NAB’s performance has clearly been unacceptable down to management not immigration, temporary or otherwise.
