Careful guys...... the huge jump after the win by 'The Don' may not have been an influence of his victory!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Think for all the 'Shorters'  'Hedge Funds' etc... those that sold out on the 'So call Experts' advice!!!a lot  sold down BIG TIME.......... and had to cover thier 'little bottoms' (dont like saying ar .. se )

However I do think ' The Don's'  challenge will be to meet his agenda. Especially with all the 'Repub..... Establishment'

I say great I like positive people and think guys.... If he's successful.. so is the old U S of A and then all us Planet dwellers.

I'am for positivity and achievers.... One post I read said he has been bankrupt... Well so was Walt Disney  many times.

Also maybe he's the right guy in the right place at the right time....the old U S of A's finances dont seem to be in 'good shape'

Obama ..................did not seem to have 'financial skills'

All IMHO  and DYOR
