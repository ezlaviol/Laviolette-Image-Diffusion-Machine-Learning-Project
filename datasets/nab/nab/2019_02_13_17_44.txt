You obviously didn't appreciate what @padbear said, so I will make it as clear as possible for you.

PGH.ASX does not make bricks, and their SP has nothing to do with bricks.

Boral sold their financial interest in PGH pavers (this is not listed on the ASX) to CSR.ASX in the last few years, who now owns them. 

So one more time to be clear. PGH pavers make bricks and they are not the same as PGH.ASX (Pact Group Holdings) who does not make bricks.
