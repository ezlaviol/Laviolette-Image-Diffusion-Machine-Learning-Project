2020-04-29T13:41:00+10:00 : Fair point.... from 2018 Annual ReportBack in 2008, NAB allowed retail shareholders to apply for $10,000 in new shares and this has been increaed to $30,000 in the current SPP.NAB only receievd $250 million in offers to purchase new shares in 2008 and accordingly there was no scale back. Not sure on the number of small shareholders back then....I intend on applying for $30k - if i get scaled back so be it... but i dont think it will be alot based on what happened in 2008 (Perhaps 30%, who knows..)
