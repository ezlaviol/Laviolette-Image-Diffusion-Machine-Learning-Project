2020-04-27T11:30:00+10:00 : I think it is worth having a look at actual figures and position (I think many don't understand capital requirements of banks). 
Capital raising will increased Cet1 ratio to 11.2% which places NAB in very strong position. (CR of $3.5b adds 81 basis points!!)
Dividend payout ratio reduced to 35% (ex notables)
Little doubt, however,  the real hits will come in 2nd half of financial year when provisions will be sorely tested.
SP will no doubt take a bit of hit when coming out of TH, however I think strategy is fair and NAB has tried to strengthen balance sheet while still returning some capital to shareholders (some who do rely on)
