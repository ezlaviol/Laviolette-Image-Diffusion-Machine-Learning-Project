Perhaps not as likely now, however swings of $2-3 are fairly normal for a bank. It is trading post dividend so that accounts for $1 of the  $3 drop. Then we have a RC and way way overpriced houses so likely movements in interest rates start to spook bank investors with QE.  Nab has the lowest exposure to housing and more business loans as far as I know so would likely survive better than the other banks less whatever scandal is up next. Personally I think $29 is a screaming bargain but prices can go lower, really just depending on who wants to sell. Can I have yours for $25? ;-)
