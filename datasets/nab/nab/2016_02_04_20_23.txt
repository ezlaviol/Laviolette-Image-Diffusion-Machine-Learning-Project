2016-02-04T20:23:00+11:00 : CYB closed at $4.00 today on the ASX and daily high was $4.09 so holding the CDIS may turn out to be the most prudent move depending on how many you hold - bigger holdings make sense as the brokerage of $25-$30 would require at least 30c just to cover costs if you only hold around 100 cdis.

Having said that, she is up almost that much already so those that sold (like me) may look foolish down the track.
