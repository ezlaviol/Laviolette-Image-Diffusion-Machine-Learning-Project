All he is doing is reducing taxes for companies - not abolishing them.Would work in the UK but I don't know if they are even considering it.

Land tax should be ended in spite of who levies it for companies like NAB to survive and prosper. Income tax and payroll tax should be eliminated as well and replaced with a broad based consumption tax.President Trump and the Administration are planning something like that, If American banks are benefitted by the abolition of property taxes, employment taxes and income taxes in favor of consumption taxes, that will significantly disadvantage Australian banks like NAB.The English Treasury was planning something like that so those English Banks such as HSBC and Barclays may also receive more support than the Australian banks if income tax, property taxes and employment taxes are eliminated and replaced with broad consumption taxes.
