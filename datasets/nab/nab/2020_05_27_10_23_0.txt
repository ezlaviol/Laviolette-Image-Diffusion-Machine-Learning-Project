2020-05-27T10:23:00+10:00 : Too may inputs we don't know to have a reasonable guess at the outcome.What was the total holdings of the people that applied?How many people will only get the minimum amount ?How many people will get limited at the $30K ( someone may hold $10M worth of shares but will only get $30k worth)?Will the number of shares asked for be taken into account? If two people had 2000 shares each but one asked for $30K and one asked for $15K , will they receive the same amount if the scale back goes below $15K ?Just some thoughts.
