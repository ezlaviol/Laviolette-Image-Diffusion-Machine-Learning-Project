I did buy some shares at 25.92 however offloaded same day $26.70 range as couldn’t resist an intraday 3% odd. Also expected markets to likely retreat in the US on Friday but appears I was very wrong!!!!Albeit I bought a lot of WBC at circa 21.17 on Thursday. Let’s see Mondays results which I expect will be positive on cost cutting. Could be wrong again!!!
