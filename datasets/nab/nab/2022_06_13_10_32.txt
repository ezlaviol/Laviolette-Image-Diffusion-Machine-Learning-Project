2022-06-13T10:32:00+10:00 : As we speak (approximately 1027 AEST) Dow futures off more than 300 points, so the possible market collapse may be at hand?  Your forecast may be feasible, nobody factored in a GFC or global pandemic, so a 1930's recession or worse may be at hand.  Newly installed socialist Federal Govt and the RBA, merely a housing for overly remunerated academics unable to perform at any metric in the previous several years, as to monetary policy, yet to see the market fallouts.  Not a good scenario at all.
