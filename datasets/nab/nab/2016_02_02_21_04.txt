I haven't seen anything definitive on the likely CYB market price when it lists.  Even if it is down a little I wouldn't think it will be significantly below the Â£1.80 (=A$3.90) as it seems already strongly discounted.

What this means to the NAB share price I don't really know but I will hold to my view that this means around $1 per NAB share in lost entitlement when they go EX tomorrow.

So we should know tomorrow (based on the indicative dates in todays announcement).  Of course, if too many other factors move the market tomorrow we may never know the impact of this factor alone!

Of course all this is based on the limited factors I know and ignores any logic the wider market is using!
