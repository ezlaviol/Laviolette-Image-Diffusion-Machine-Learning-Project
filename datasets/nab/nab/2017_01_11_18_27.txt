I think NAB is pretty much fully priced but will bound back in if it goes back to oversold $29 levels. I think it should say in the $30s for now but the run will become a crawl.

It is better than CBA and I have thought that for a wee while now but against others out there such as WBC, BOQ, BEN and ANZ, don't know about NAB.

Agree with Morgan Stanley as ashamed I am to say that and I can't stand Weisenberg and the sacreligious, non-pious and unGodly adult industry and NAB seems to have become a victim of that.

It is a bit like the Borat has had an impact on NAB.
