2020-06-05T10:31:00+10:00 : This is on the upward spiral $30 down to $13 almost 60% loss in value, way overdone for a blue chip, it's just correcting itself back to fair value which should've only been a 20-30% drop anyway. pandemic way overdone and NAB is on the SP recovery, should settle around $21-$22 before moving upwards later this year
