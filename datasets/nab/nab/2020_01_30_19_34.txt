2020-01-30T19:34:00+11:00 : did not last a long time for an Assistant Company sEcretary. Along with the courageous appointment of Simon McKeon to the Board, you would have to question what is going on now that Ross McEwen is there? The NAB SP is not improving much. The whole thing is totally underwhelming. he needs to be making good appointments not announcing resignations which is the opposite of what we want, we want more not less to stop all these CAS, compliance issues and fee issues.
