2019-10-14T17:20:00+11:00 : I think the big banks get 60% of their funding from home loans Flip61 - Small banks get theirs entirely from the global load markets and they are really very low loan rates - hence they could cut by the full amount.If the big 4, as you say, are being pushed because their normal funding source is getting to be of a lower benefit, then they can't afford to pass on the full amount.

I'm sure you don't get to be Federal Treasurer without some basic knowledge of how the Oz Banks get their funding.  Josh Frydenberg would be well aware that our Bank's get most of their funding from offshore sources, so the RBA rate has relevance to them mainly in the pricing of what they pay investors.  The investors funds that are on-lent into the home loan sector are the only bit that they can price lower.  The way I see it, for example is, if they are borrowing 60% of their funds offshore, 10% from their own reserves & 30% from investors, they can really only be expected to pass on 30% of the RBA rate reduction.  This is only an example, I don't know the actual percentage break up, but I hope this clarifies the position for some.Full disclosure - I'm an ex CommBank Manager of 26 years.  I always say if you haven't worked for a Bank, you have no right to hate them as much as those who have !!
