2020-04-27T10:42:00+10:00 : NAB were around $30 some weeks back!With Covid-19 restrictions already starting to lift, investors are pondering the future. One way to look at it is the world has taken long sevice leave... and stayed home. As some say the world will not be the same after this, I think it's highly likely once all restrictions are lifted people will be going gang busters to make up for lost time. There will be winners & losers but one thing's for sure, people will be borrowing to get back on their feet $$$$$
