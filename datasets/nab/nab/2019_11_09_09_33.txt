You seem to be very experienced with this share game - I can assure you, I am not.Relax and take things so personally I am very intrigued on what strategies you use.

I wasnt referring to you and who i was talking to is now on ignore  , but it applies to anyone who is a prick , i dont mind discussing facts but it needs to be adult and backed by some sort of evidence/facts  . The point i make on bias is dont make it permanent ie a " perma " . i buy some things then short them soon afer  .  I have no love for any stock / index / commodity . I am only interested in the next 4 - 10 weeks and only a few hours at most daytrading . I am a systematic trader and i listen to maths whether that be technicals or fundamentals & apply quantitative analysis to both aspects and in many cases combine both simualtaneously
