2019-12-18T20:44:00+11:00 : real clever
notice ALL the Public Service departments
now coming out and going to do ...with fines and things
to almost attack the Banks for all kinds of things

BUT NOW
think where were these well paid public servants
over the years
that regulated the Banks etc
to protect the average Joe

where were they ?

the whole, complete problem is
NOT the Banks
BUT the over paid lazy public servants
NOT doing what they
they were paid for
