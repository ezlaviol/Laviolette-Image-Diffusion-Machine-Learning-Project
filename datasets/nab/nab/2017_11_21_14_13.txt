This is not advice for others, it's simply my approach to NAB. Others will disagree, but we have debates like this on the NAB forum every time she pushes up above $30...$31...$32 the lemmings appear and are bullish about buying NAB, insisting it's still a bargain. And they have been proven wrong every single time.
