And if it all hits the fan, remember, even during the GFC, when the price of NAB started with a 1, it still paid out $1.46 dividend for the year in 2009, fully franked. On today's price that is a fully grossed up return of 8.42%!! If that is the worst case scenario, then it is not so bad.

Of course the worst case scenario is that it NAB falls over. If that happens however, in my opinion, I think you will have other things to worry about than money, like food, water and staying alive......
