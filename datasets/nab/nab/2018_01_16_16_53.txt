NAB is the blue chip dud that simply keeps on giving. The problem being that all she gives is a loss in a bull market.

She will be a very good counter-cyclical play shortly when I trim money from the speculative bolters in my portfolio, she will be at $28 and I'll be able to plonk it straight back in at a very good yield whilst I await CBAs trillion dollar money laundering fine.

CBA is the only target worth shooting in the banks but I want to see the fine/settlement before I pull the trigger.
