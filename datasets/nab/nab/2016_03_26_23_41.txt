2016-03-26T23:41:00+11:00 : I was extending the downtrend lines on my chart, it's just an estimate imho .As Siam was saying NAB is still in a downtrend with all other banks since April last year  and hasn't reversed yet. $22 is a very strong support going back to 2011-2012, that's why i am expecting a bounce from there.
