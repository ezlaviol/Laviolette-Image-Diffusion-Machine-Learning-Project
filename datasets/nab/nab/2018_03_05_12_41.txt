2018-03-05T12:41:00+11:00 : Was stopped out of my NAB holdings today around $30 after loading up at low $28 I was trailing it up with a stop tighter than usual. I wanted to sell them over $30 and simply stuck to the plan.

I've posted many times here that I like NAB as a good divvy yield play, and of course it may still command a position in many portfolios on that basis alone.

My primary reason for stopping out has been the general crap performance of banking stocks, and what I perceive as fairly high risk coming out if the royal commission in addition to a potential contagion effect when CBA has to finally pay the piper on those money laundering issues.

I just don't think it's going to be a great six months in the banking sector, prefer to shift my capital over to much more positive sectors at this time.
