2016-07-25T09:42:00+10:00 : Peter Moran of Wilson HTM has upgraded NAB to a buy on valuation grounds. He expects a total return (including dividends) of 20 per cent during the next 12 months. While he recognizes earnings growth will be subdued as bad debts lift off historically low levels, he believes this is already factored in the share price. Over the longer term, NAB will benefit from growth in its market leading business banking franchise. After recent divestments, the de-risked bank deserves a re-rating IHO but pls DYOR.
