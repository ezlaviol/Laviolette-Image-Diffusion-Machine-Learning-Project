I think it will be a good day for the market as a whole, not just NAB.There is a general sense that the US and China will sort out this Trade Deal, and the effect of that could raise the DOW by 2000 points. So the flow on from that will be the ASX will also raise by a similar amount, dragging NAB along with it.
