2022-08-09T11:00:00+10:00 : rather insipid result, impairments are still low and recent NIM hasn't really moved significantly but as already pointed out by previous poster this should improve next Qtr. The big four still continue to show no long term growth or share price appreciation (2002 price was approx $29.50). As always simply one for the dividends.
