2020-04-27T22:01:00+10:00 : again, you’re investing in high risk and speculative jumping in afterpay. You would not sell millions in bank shares, pay a few million in CGT and go all in on one loss making IPO would you? Or even concentration risk. if I beat the accumulation index which none of you even seem to know what it is, then I am happy and beating 97% of FMs. Compounding index based returns is what I am doing. You guys are using hindsight on multibagging high risk tech stocks as an opportunity cost... you’ve got to be kidding. Use the benchmark which is the ASX200 accumulation index that is dividend inclusive, which is the opportunity cost vs an index fund. Not, I went all in on afterpay, a loss making millennial online credit card company for millions of dollars and made another 500% gain....which equally could have had a sad story of losing the lot too.you guys are trading quick bucks and speculative. Completely different profile. I have a structured portfolio across 40 generally large cap stocks at varying weighting’s. It’s comparable apples with oranges, not even! More like a can of coke to an orange!
