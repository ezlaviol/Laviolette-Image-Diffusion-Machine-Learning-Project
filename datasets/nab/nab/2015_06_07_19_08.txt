I have been in banks since the early nineties and they have been good to me and buying on down turns helps.Credit growth may slow and yields will be steady and not grow as quickly  as they have.
NAB have made some lousy decisions over the years and SP should be up with CBA.
There is talk that NAB holders will get pro rata entitlement to Clydesdale shares ,if they going to give them to shareholders are they a dud investment and if not why wouldn't NAB keep them?
