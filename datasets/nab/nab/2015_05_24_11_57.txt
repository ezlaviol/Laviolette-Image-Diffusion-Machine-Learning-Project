I enjoy your posts.
I have followed and acquired shares in NAB fairly aggressively over the past 12 years.
My view is that often these large corporations "succeed" in spite of themselves.
NAB has made  more than it's fair share of mistakes eg Homeside/Clydesdale Bank etc.
Under this new management they seem intent on rectifying past mistakes.
I am not too fussed about problems with MLC.
Management in all of these places is generally pretty poor.
In my view AMP was/is? a case in point.
I never over rate the intelligence or business "smarts" of our corporate leaders.
Consider that NAB once made an offer of 21 bucks or so a share for AMP and the board of AMP rejected the offer!!
Not sure, but I think that offer occurred under the leadership of the sainted Don Argus aka Don't Argue (Argus.)
If not, my unreserved apologies to Mr Argus.
I might add that AMP has never since been within a bull's roar of 20 bucks!
Be interesting to see the share price when the new shares come on.
My guess is that we will see something round 30 bucks with a fairly rapid recovery.
Cheers,
crat
