NAB is the smallest of my bank holdings yet I hold far more than someone who has been working ten years more than I last did. Its all great that he added to his NAB holdings but considering what he is paid and is worth its a token amount.I am happy that after all the negative news announcements by them I am still up over 8% on my entry a few weeks ago with a small divi to come and some discount SPP shares to add that will further lower my average. NAB is not a growth stock but at least it is paying a reduced dividend that in time will start to grow again when the virus runs its course. I am happy that even with all the negative news out for now I am still ahead and hopefully we dont retest the March lows down the track. Time will tell but in a couple of years from now I am sure the SP and dividends will be well north of their current levels.
