2020-05-04T17:11:00+10:00 : It's a near certainty that it will be heavily scaled back while the share price is where it is. There's just too little shares on offer - $500m - and too many shareholders 574,000 as at last annual report. If only 3% of NAB shareholders subscribed for $30k shares, that's over $500m worth already. And I guarantee you that there will be more than 3 out of 100 shareholders who want in on the offer. So, there will be a scaleback - pretty heavily I'd imagine, given the scarcity of SPP shares relative to demand.(NAB may increase the offer, but even if they doubled the SPP that's still enough for say, 6% instead of 3% of the shareholder base to take up full entitlements. Any way you cut it, folks aren't going to get what they applied for - unless the market crashes.)
