2020-04-23T16:25:00+10:00 : doubt it, unless COVID gets worse. APRA already issued its warnings so you’ll find a lot of the redemptions have already happened or are occurring right now in preparation for the $10k. the issue is buying. They won’t be buying back into the market as all contributions which are billions a month across all funds would be used to cross over to their cash holdings rather than be invested in equities or other asset classes. Mind find once this passes a swift rally occurs as they are net buying. The funds need to find a home.Will see what happens I guess. No one really knows the extent of the liquidity for $10k per effected person.
