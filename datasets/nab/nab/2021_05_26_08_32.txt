2021-05-26T08:32:00+10:00 : Nothing is proven, so don't take this article's union assertions as 'fact' - but its merely FYI.A much more important issue than Australian banks such as NAB virtue signalling in imposing idiotic conditions on loans to miners of vital coal!From 'Herald Sun' (Melbourne), Wednesday 26 May 2021:Underpaid staff could cost NABNATIONAL Australia Bank and the Finance Sector Union are headed to the federal court over what could be the nation’s biggest staff underpayment issue, possibly in the hundreds of millions of dollars.FSU state secretary for Queensland Wendy Streets said the union was about to lodge Federal Court proceedings.The FSU’s legal advisers will meet this week to determine the best way to proceed.“We had a member meeting six weeks ago and a resolution was passed to brief a barrister,” she said. “There is case law which supports both sides but we believe we are right.”The dispute between NAB and the FSU relates to alleged underpayment of full-time staff.While the bank has already paid $55 million in compensation to current and former staff, they were part-timers.Ms Streets said the number of full-time staff potentially affected was much greater.If the court found in the union’s favour, she said the bank’s exposure could run to hundreds of millions of dollars.Full-time staff at the group three and group four levels across the bank were paid in excess of $100,000 a year, and the bank’s position was that the extra hours in dispute above 40-hour weeks amounted to “reasonable additional work” given the seniority of the affected people.“But most of our members are working 50-60 hours a week, not 40,” Ms Streets said.
