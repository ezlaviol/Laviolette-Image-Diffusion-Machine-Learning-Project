2019-09-03T17:34:00+10:00 : If the unemployment rate rises to 20% then I doubt it will be any difference between banks and other businesses - we'd all be sort of stuffed.$200-300mil is less than the banks write every year from bad debts and not too relevant (if it even happens to go into default) against a company with a capital value approaching $80bil.We will agree at least that the economy is stagnating and I suspect we already have a recession. No indications it is collapsing and things always go up and down. Always better to swim against the current and buy when others are so frightened they want to sell.

im.not giving you investment advice , I'm just asking questions no one else is asking. I don't mind being ridiculed at all as it all part of the debate about knowing how the risk is spread in the economy. Im asking questions but I not heard a whisper with some clues even but even so it would be handy to have more info because small businesses have noticed business has dropped off the table and they all mystified as to why and for how long this "beginning of a recession" is going to last . Some people who don't ask questions are going to help those with more of an inquiring mind and decide the yield might not be sustainable for more than 5 years maybe? AfterPay had a revolving line of credit with NAB of maybe $200-300 million but not sure how much it is now but imagine it having continuing or growing losses , how will NAB be impacted I don't know but I'm asking the questions why is APRA ok with this form of unsecured loans but won't let some people buy houses which have a better chance of getting their money back than millions of small unsecured amounts in event of unemployment rising 20% to 6%?  imo it would help if RBA or the unreliable but believable ABS would release some words of comfort to stabilise employers concerns. Why is the RBA dropping the Cash Rate? A better explanation is needed imo.
