2018-05-19T07:54:00+10:00 : As I said I’ll buy more. Not a trader, and a substantial amount of the shares we hold are from the 1990s and earlier. Large CGT. Equally you’ll never buy at the bottom, nor sell at the top. 

I see a bright future for the banks in the long term. I am more concerned about wealth management businesses, of which I sold out of. Sold the last of the dud AMP 2 years back. Glad I did as the businesses like that will be even worse in the future.
