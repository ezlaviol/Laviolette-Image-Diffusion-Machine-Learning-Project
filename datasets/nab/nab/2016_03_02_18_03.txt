2016-03-02T18:03:00+11:00 : Banks are out of trouble...as 

Markets and commodities have Bottomed ...and have started a recover uptrend to test Recent tops for a Breakout  ..upwards.

All possibly due to a change in Infrastructure spending Commitments ..from G20 leaders
and worldwide Federal Bank Governors ...looking to Stimulate their economies .

Negative rates ..will push cash out of savings ..and into Income producing Asset investment and Start ups IPO ...leading to increased Employment opps and Wages Growth for the Masses..
New Tech Innovation ..may spur entirely new industries.  eg Power Storage = lithium batteries

with IOL and Steel + Copper Prices ..massaged up and maintained at a Balance favorable to both Producers and Consumers ..during the infrastructure Rebuilds and developments.
why ??
just ask BHP RIO VALE  Shareholders  what they think ..about their latest Q results.. from their stupid  Supply War .

$50 for oil
$65 for IO
and $3 for Copper..is ideal
Coal price is dead ..while Gas price rises slowly as it replaces Coal in power Stations.

Banks recover.. as Commodities and their Producers country Budgets recover ..on improved demand Conditions worldwide from Infrastructure Stimulus's...and a return to some Inflation as Commodities rise.
