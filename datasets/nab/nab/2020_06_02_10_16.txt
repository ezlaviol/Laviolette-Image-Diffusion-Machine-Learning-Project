2020-06-02T10:16:00+10:00 : Seems there's a fair amount of disquiet amongst retail holders about how NAB handled this cap raise. And rightly so given the double whammy dilution of their holdings without compensation. Yes we've been stung: once by the size of the insto raise compared with our retail offer and again by the scaleback of the retail.NAB isn't the only guilty party in the recent cap raises but its been outstanding....If you feel strongly about this can i suggest you contact NAB's shareholder centre directly (don't bother with computershare as you'll end up in the Philippines).Here's some detailRetail Shareholder ServicesNicki Papadopoulos, Head of Shareholder ServicesPhone: +61 (03) 8634 2366Lachlan Greer, Senior AnalystPhone: +61 (03) 8634 8507[email protected]or if you really want needle them go hereInstitutional Investor RelationsGroup Investor RelationsLevel 28, 255 George StreetSydney NSW 2000Australia[email protected]+61 (02) 9237 9510And finally, vote your shares at the next AGM...Cheers
