I bet yr looking back now at yr 27.25 purchase and thinking.. Why did I do that! Same for me with my $26 purchase. But it's all a learning experience and make sure the numbers are green when you sell. A green of $1 is better than a red of $1. Might have to wait for NAB to touch $25 again but with the US elections coming up later this year I think that will be the next reason for a nuclear bomb to hit the markets even though the possibility of Trump winning is an absolute zero. Forget the media and look at the bookmakers. The probability of the bookmakers getting it wrong is a lot lower than the 24hr media cycle. Just like the brexit vote. Chances? Close to zero, but the buying opportunity was sweet. Next stop, US elections. A few months away but let's start it up. Trump for the win 

P.s No way trump is winning anything but the buying opportunity is open to everyone.
