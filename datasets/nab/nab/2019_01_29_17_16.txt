Interesting times for the Banks as there are bound to be some shocks in the report that have not been accounted for.NAB is creeping back to my re-entry point < $24. Will the banks bounce on the bad news from the RC? Is the bad news factored in? Well I dont know the answer to that so will buy when it feels right and hang on for a few years when they might be trading circa $30 with a $2 annual div.Looking for 8.5% yield (excluding franking credits) on $1.98 annual div. for re-entry.
