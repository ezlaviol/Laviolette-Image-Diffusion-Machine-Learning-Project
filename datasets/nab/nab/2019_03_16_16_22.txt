Not RC related but watch for another payout to be announced next week just on disruption to phone banking this week imo. Remember we paid $30m for the issues with Eftpos terminals last year to compensate for disruption to retailers. Everyone will have their hand out and the bank will be more than willing to pay out to repair its image in the community.
