2016-06-28T17:21:00+10:00 : Compare the banks today at 4.00PM:

MQG UP 1.45%.... 3rd best on ASX200
BEN UP 1.3%
NAB UP 0.78%
WBC UP 0.85%
CBA UP 0.66%
ANZ UP 0.34%
BOQ UP 0.2%

Plus bear in mind ANZ has fallen the most of Big 4 over past 12 months. Clearly Mr Mkt remains very wary of earnings going fwd.
