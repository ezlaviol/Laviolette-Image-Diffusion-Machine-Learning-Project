Youâ€™ve also received $20 plus franking credits of dividends - hence a decent return of which you need to add back as the performance.... And lastly your picking a point in time where almost all banks are at GFC or 20 year lows due to a global viral pandemic... this was $30 high around 7 months ago... buying bank shares below book value with 11% teir 1 capital. Fine by me. Unless you think the world is going to end financially from this.sure, you can go pull out a wonderful stock such as CSL.... hindsight.
