2020-04-29T18:28:00+10:00 : dont agree with SP automatically dropping .... just look at nab price today.  The Share placement may dilute future dividends , but with this volatility into the foreseeable future , it really wont matter.  For me, I intend to apply for maximum ( unless the nab share price falls below $14.15 close to the closing date )
