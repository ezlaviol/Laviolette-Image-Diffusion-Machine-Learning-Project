Banks provide channels for the economy to grow again.Imo, banks will do well in the next 12 months and this trend could continue for several years. Big four should do very well. Retirees have been writing to RBA complaining the lack of income due to record low interest rate. Some may force to invest in equities to generate greater income. In my opinion, many will pick bank stocks.
