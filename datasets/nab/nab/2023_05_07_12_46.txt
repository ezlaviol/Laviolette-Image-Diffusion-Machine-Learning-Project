A moribund CEO and BOD to match, unable to capture the real issues.  As to your buzz words, transition from what to what, and growth, what growth, NAB and especially WBC going in reverse for several years now, even with new CEO's appointed for the new environment for the banks.  The banks are there for the CEO's and BOD's certainly not for retail sh's and customers, WBC in particular the least profitable and even more so with the current CEO.  Relics from the 1980's but in your case, exciting.  Enough said.
