2020-04-22T10:17:00+10:00 : I'm not really sure what the argument is, however there are only a very small number of countries that were trying to eradicate it
The health authorities in Aus were very open that they expected it to possibly infect 50 to 60% of the population and it was plainly obvious our health system could not handle a sudden influx of a large number of cases which ultimately causes more deaths. (A fact plainly shown in many countries with an overwhelmed heath system)
So, obviously this means actual death cases are very relevant!!
Our total numbers have been contained well within expectations (much better than modelling suggested) and obviously the only struggle now is how to come out while still limiting infections and also noting that we now have greater hospital capacity (ICU/Ventilators etc)
Perhaps we have become a victim of our success?
I have little doubt we have been very lucky and for whatever reason (season, or who knows) have dodged a bullet, but also little doubt they don't want to undo any good work in the short term. 
Of course it will be extremely easy for many claims to be made after the event of what should or shouldn't have been done
