2015-11-05T10:30:00+11:00 : Divvy of 99c and smashed by around $1.40 today, certainly the best move would have been to buy ex-divvy unlike me - I topped up around $30 oops.

Given the whipping NAB share price is receiving I'm keeping my powder dry until she gets into the $26-27 range this thing is being battered and I can't see today being the end of that.
