2020-06-27T07:07:00+10:00 : It will be interesting early next week as we run into the EOFY to see where the SP ends up. Lot of selling going on at the moment across the board let alone banks.DOW took a hit overnight and fell another 700 points. Not sure of the particular reason but banking shares in the US were taking a pounding. Could be just a US centric reason but I think bank shares will open weaker on the ASX on Monday.That will mean that NAB and other banks will become even better opportunities for those who are prepared to sit and wait for six to twelve months. NAB is down around $10 on where it would normally be - and we are not in normal times but that situation won't last forever.
