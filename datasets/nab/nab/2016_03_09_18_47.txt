2016-03-09T18:47:00+11:00 : it has been a solid bounce off 3yr lows which has been tested at the $24 mark.. traditionally strong in the first half of their trading year (1H16 ends March 31)
well de-risked with the CYB off the books, capital ratios steady and bad loans down.. 
one my stocks for income at these levels! I have no expectations of maintaining the $1.98 fully franked divi but if they do I'll be laughing with 11% yield.. realistically i think it may be prudent for banks to pare back their divis slightly anyway to preserve cash.. never know when the reserve ratio might get pumped up 
Downside being that global bank sentiment not great which creates a bit of volatility but that means opportunity
