It's no secret that banks will take considerable time to rally upwards, and there are many economic factors that have yet to be factored into their share price.  NAB is well exposed to residential housing loans, and although the economy "may" swing back into action quickly, the damage has been done.  This is not even taking into account present and possible future trade embargoes by China (barley, coal, iron ore) and possible extended unemployment.Still, as indicated earlier, NAB is NOT folding and the bank will climb back eventually.  This is why I believe the outlook is 3-5 years.I'd be interested in hearing other people's viewpoint.
