But I'll give less weight to those that are careless (such as spelling mistakes).True, I've probably made a few mistakes in my posts ( capitals, apostrophes, and there's a tendency to omit a word or 2 as I get older  .... and that can be crucial).But spelling mistakes are really evidence of slipshod thinking.   Ok, I accept that most posters couldnt give a stuff as to whether I care about spelling.   Thats fine.    Just thought I'd say.
