2019-02-13T11:25:00+11:00 : look at Boral today ? Boral today is different than original Boral. Boral sold it Brick business to PGH but kept the roof tiles business..Roof tiles business is very tiny and does not make major part of any house. Bluescope is fighting for market. Builders are happy to install Bluescope as it takes less than 1 days for an installer...Cant compare apples with oranges, althoughÂ both grows on trees
