2019-05-18T16:12:00+10:00 : Picked up more NAB for my SMSF (Pension mode) this week cum dividend around $25.30. For me, the full value of the dividend including the franking credit is around $1.20. So just under adjusted entry valuation around $24.Dont believe for one moment that SP will dive from here and retouch GFC values like some punters and downrampers on this site. On the contrary, I firmly believe that banks are oversold and all credible analysts see NAB valued at around $30+in any event, the reduced dividend will be maintained going forward and I am very happy to receive tax free dividends of around 7%. Capital gains a bonus. Must have long term view here ie in 10 years time NAB will still be a major bank, and if still sitting mid $20â€™s I will have received 70%+ dividend returns tax free. Easy money.....DYOR
