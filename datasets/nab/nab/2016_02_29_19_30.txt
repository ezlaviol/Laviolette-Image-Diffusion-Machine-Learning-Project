2016-02-29T19:30:00+11:00 : I must agree you raise a very good point about it being the wife's fault What did you mean 6-8 dollars over sold ? Or do you mean under sold. 

 I don't own any banks in my portfolio but if I did I was gonna buy ANZ as it cheeper and is also in New Zealand  so I thought it might be a bit more diversified then NAB,  but I did not get that choice sing my wife brought these NAB shares by mistake.  

 I haven't really studied the banks  but I can't understand why all the banks are so low in the share price and I'm just wondering if Nan will ever go under the $20 price or have we hit bottom.  

 Any thoughts would be much appreciated as this area is not my forte in the share market.

Darren
