2020-05-26T13:46:00+10:00 : wednesday week (first day new shares can be traded) it may drop down to the 14.15 level from profit takers...but happy for it to forge upwards, no matter, if I don't get my full allocation I will be looking to buy on market.  Off the top of my head, I think my first 300 odd shares were at approx $25, so its a no brainer for me.Still reckon a bounce to $20 by xmas.
