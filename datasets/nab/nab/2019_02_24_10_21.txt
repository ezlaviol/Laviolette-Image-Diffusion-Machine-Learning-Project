Maybe look back as far as the 1970's - I believe that CBA and NAB were vying to be Australia's biggest bank at that time. CBA was in government hands back then too. There were more banks  then and the consolidation of banks to create the big 4 happened in 1978/79 - I worked for a year in the Commercial Bank of Australia in 1977 (merged with Westpac I recall). At that stage ANZ and Westpac were slightly smaller than NAB and CBA. CBA really took off when it was floated in the 1990's(??)
