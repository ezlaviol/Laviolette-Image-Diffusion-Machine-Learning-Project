2018-05-20T14:03:00+10:00 : please explain why you see a bright future.
I see :  
* flat or slightly falling earnings and flat dividends.
* high pay out ratios ( NAB 83% ) mean can't raise easily dividends 
*rising interest rates in future  :  less borrowing and rise in defaults
  default rates have been at all time lows due to record low interest rates
  but can't last forever.  
*property market weakening
*more regulation, scrutiny and compliance costs after the current scandals
*regulators demanding higher capital ratios 
* despite recent falls, NAB price to book ratio still 1.43,   WBC 1.6,   CBA 1.93,
these are very high by global standards and higher than  American banks
which actually are growing earnings.
*Australia hasn't had a recession for over 25 yrs,  can't last forever

etc
etc

the Aussie banks are facing lots of headwinds.
Sure they will remain profitable and continue to pay handy dividends and I wouldn't
necessarily sell them if you are happy with just dividends, but they
have little or no chance of substantial organic earnings growth ( not including
cost reductions and asset sales ) in the next several years.
