2020-03-08T09:10:00+11:00 : Looking back & watching NAB chart history, there are so many stories in the dips...some of them took longer while & some of them recovered quickly but...here is how I see the turn of events.., Since GFC NAB hasn’t recovered it share price fully...infact NAB has never recovered its SP since then on every major dip. Fact # 1: On average NAB has only been able to recover 12% lower on average in 2 years timesFact# 2: By 12% means NAB, from its recent highs of 29 $ NAB will only recover back to 25$ in 2022how future will unfold, again we need to look back & see GFC when RBA cut 50% interest rate in 1 year & banking sector compromised for the sake of economy. So far, RBA has cut 25 base points which is 33% & more likely to cut more in April if things wont settle soon. NAB will report less EBIT & ppl will sell then NAB will report less dividend & ppl will sell even more. This is happening in next 6 months.Trigger, rate cut, zero rate, negative rate, debt, balance of payment crisis, GFC. The first two boxes are tick so. Let’s see how much potential Covid has . What we don’t know is the bottom of SP but what we don’t know that SP will recover back to 25$ in 2 years time. Who do ever is happy with that & have deep pockets should buy now. A 10% dividend with 12% upside in two years from NAB is excellent. There can be huge potential of 40% to 50% if someone can wait patiently. DYOA & no panic time now, panic will start if 15$ won’t hold.
