2020-03-23T10:06:00+11:00 : What are the chances banks will convert customer deposits in to shares based on bail-in laws?I asked NAB for $1m in cash withdrawal from bank last week and they initially said yes. 2 hours later they call back and say no. i asked for 250k per week or even 100k per week, they called back and said no. sighting “security” as the reason, they offered me cash withdrawals around the 5-20k mark “like I had done the day before”.Is it odd for a bank to not give you your money? They said it is “outside of normalcy” and “everyone wants cash right now”?maybe I should buy gold?
