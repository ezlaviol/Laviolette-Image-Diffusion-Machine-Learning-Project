2022-06-08T17:08:00+10:00 : Too soon to be buying Banks yet. Most likely a dead cat bounce prior to next 50 basis points RBA rate hike which may force share price down to circa, $27.50 level.Best to let market prove a bottom is in place as the eventual bottom will be re tested then show a leg up. That's what I am looking for anyway. Catching falling knives and all that.......................naa wait for the bottom to show up. Bear markets take about 18 mths to play out. We are just starting out.
