2019-09-03T18:29:00+10:00 : I stated 20% increase to 6% unemployment rate from 5% rate, however if you read Roy Morgan Research stats they been saying we have had 18% unemployment for some time lol im.not frightened as I don't hold direct or indirect NAB shares but obviously we all lose if AfterPay were to fall on harder times, in any case they could support a few more CR at these levels to cover ongoing losses. Good luck to you all if it pays off for both APT & NAB.
