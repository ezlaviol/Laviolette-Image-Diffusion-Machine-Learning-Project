2019-01-31T20:17:00+11:00 : Thanks for clarification..Some one buying right at the highest peaked price, it is possible (I have done that mistake my self with few stocks, but never again)..Currently Banks are out of Favor. But just matter of time before they become market darling again. 3 more days and we will know outcome of Royal Commission.. As per my understanding Royal Commission Does Not Have Power to Punish Anybody, Royal Commission can only make recommendations WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO AVOID REPEAT ? ..One thing sure "Greed Never Dies" That's is how market operates else Banks will delist from ASX and become Non Profit NGOs
