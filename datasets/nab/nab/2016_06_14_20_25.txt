One thing it shows is the market has about a two week attention span-tops. The US election is too far away, even the Aussie election at three weeks is not in the market's mind. But Brexit is now less than two weeks away and the five year olds running the stock market can start to think about it.

I thought even by the market's low standards of information gathering last night was pretty funny. Overseas they were all down and then... a rumour started going around that a poll was coming out showing support for the Remain case... and the markets shot up.

Needless to say, by morning that rumour was found to be unfounded and the markets had crashed again.
