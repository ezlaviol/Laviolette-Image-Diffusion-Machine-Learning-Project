2016-07-06T13:48:00+10:00 : Bought a trade at $24.18 and sold at $24.35

Also bought NAB's stable mate CYB $3.61

Not entirely sure whether to hang onto CYB, but do see value at these levels. Just think the market will spike the banks lower still in the next few days.

Love the Italian banks fail comment. Italian banks have been a fail since GFC!
