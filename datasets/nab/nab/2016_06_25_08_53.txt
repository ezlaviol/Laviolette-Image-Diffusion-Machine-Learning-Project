The way I see it you can put your money in the bank and get very little or you can have a go (be it real estate, Gold, stocks, Etc). If you have a go you are sometimes going to get it wrong. Having said that, and this is why I love the Nab, I have a core of shares that I have been holding since the start of the year at an average SP of around 27. Since then I have had a bonus share offer in Cybg (worth about 1 dollar per nab share)  and 1 div worth about 1.4 after tax credits. Funnily enough 27 minus 2.4 is 24.6 which is where we are now. So I break even on that parcel! I am at the accumulation stage of my great journey so as long as I preserve overall capital, it will all work out. I am also fortunate in that I can add more funds to my shares each month. In the long term I can buy all the way down to $10 or whatever, if I choose. This is not advice by the way. Don't do what I do. I have no idea. Seriously. 
And @Lurkin, a good family friend (retired) has a shed load of Nab shares and he doesn't give a hoot what the Sp is. He has been holding / buying since the 80's and never looked back. So as long as you don't panic it all usually works out. Overall I have not managed to close a position on a loss on the stocks in the ASX20; they have been good to me. Totally different story on the little guys some of which got pounded yesterday (makes me wonder why I bother). 
I think this is a good buying opportunity, trouble is there may well be a better price next week, and I have little left in the tank , at least till next month! Speaking of which dividends on the 1st of July. ï¿¼
Let's see if, as @JCoure says, fortune favours the bold. We all know the market over reacts (in fact we hope for it). Bring on next week. I am over this one. DJ futures were just green at end of trading. 
Wonder how the bookies are going......
