2021-04-22T11:59:00+10:00 : Another bad thing about NABTRADE is the incorrect prices always for the UK market.As an example, Ted Baker (TED) is showing on nabTrade as last sale 1.5716 up 2.76%Actually it should be 168.10 up over 10%. The best performer on the LSE.Really this is unforgiveable as you cannot trust any of the UK prices.
