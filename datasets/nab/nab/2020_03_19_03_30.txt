2020-03-19T03:30:00+11:00 : DOW  is down 1500 points so I can't see that NAB will hold the current SP. There has to be a natural bottom for the SP but not sure if that will be tested today.I am reminding myself constantly that the woes are because people are panicing and not the financial wellbeing of the bank itself so will see where the SP goes with the view of getting more shares at a very low price.

Just like we are still in panic mode at Woolworths, we are in for a bumpy ride a little while yet. I mean it’s 90’s prices!! But don’t see change until the shelves are full again.
