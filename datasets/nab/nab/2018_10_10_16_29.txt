Yes unfortunately, as markets mostly price ahead and if -God forbid- Billy boy gets the PM's hat. We could see neg-gearing in a big shakeup so maybe the Bank's Div could take a bit of a hit. Also NABs div payout -I believe - $ wise takes much more of its net P  than any of the other Banks. That's from memory.

Also The Lab Party would have control of both houses.....................................Wow yahoo party time...NOT!

Keep safe all Nab'ers

DYOR and IAIMHO
