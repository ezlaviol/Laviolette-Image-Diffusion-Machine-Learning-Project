2016-12-30T10:49:00+11:00 : Been having constant problems lately.  I tried to contact them as I couldn't login the other day and they denied there being a problem.  Absolute bunch of jokers.  They also don't release funds from a sale for sometimes hours after the trade despite claiming that they will be available immediately.
Having said that, no probs with market depth as far as I can see.
