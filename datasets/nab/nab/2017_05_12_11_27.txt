Labor - who would love to impose even stricter measure on banks & dearly love to get their hands on the cheque book again.
Greens - as above, but add return us to a grass roots simpler life with no industry
or maybe one of the single issue independents and their collective rabble parties who appear to have only a small grasp of basic economics.
Perhaps Pauline and a 2% flat tax??
I am always intrigued as to what the alternatives are when someone makes a statement like that........................
