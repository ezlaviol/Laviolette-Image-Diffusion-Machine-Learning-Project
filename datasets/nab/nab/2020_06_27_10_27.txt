2020-06-27T10:27:00+10:00 : No one can be certain but we can postulate based on past evidence, fair value and the potential of the economy recovering to some extent.Before the recent pull back, NAB's SP was recovering fast (and I suppose the same can be said for the other 3 main banks). Banks are essential for any economy - and we all know that anyway. The big 4 are resilient and, while we can expect lower profits and lower dividends in the immediate future, the banks are still making modest profits. Re-opening of the economy - with all the inherent dangers that will be encountered - will slowly push SPs up - I don't think we will see SP's in the 30's for quite awhile but mid 20's is more than possible in 12 months.

  How could you be so sure in 6 to 12 months the Banking sector will be better? remember since gfc NAB fell from high 30s and never returned back. I'm not sure how long the Chinese economy can sustain, given current US China relationship deteriorates very quickly, and CCP becomes more and more hostile to the world. IF the Chinese economy falls into abys and there's no replacement for the demands of Australian resources, you can count on oz economy to have significant impact. NAB has higher exposure to business loans most likely will get biggest hit. However Never Say Never though.
