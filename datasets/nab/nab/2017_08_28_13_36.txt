2017-08-28T13:36:00+10:00 : I am watching that bank too,... but everyday, new development appears hammering that bank,... As it is, if the bad news never stops,. .. then that's where the waiting is valid,...

But for NAB,... I keep hearing $25 to $27 everywhere in this forum, but that day never seems to come. If I continue to wait, I will lose out on my opportunity cost, because I will BE MISSING OUT ON THE DIVVY PAYOUTS which should be in my pocket. So,... I'll take whatever I can now with NAB. Most importantly, I must have $$ to average down further if the $26 day does come.

I have the thinking that if everybody is awaiting at $26+, the instos' will gobble-up everything as soon as the price nears low-27s,...
