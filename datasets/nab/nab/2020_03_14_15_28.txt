2020-03-14T15:28:00+11:00 : this is actually very typical through a bear market.there will be a few more tough days to come.150,000 infections is very early in the piecelet’s see how the share price is when it is closer to 15,000,000 infections.daily infections have jumped to 10,000 a day, in a week or 2 this may very well be 100,000 infections a day.In 3-4 weeks governments will announce the closure of all non essential business, inc schools, uni, tafe and workplaces.AKA wave 2. This will be when the virus gets real, and the stock market plunge.This is going to happen, why?I can confirm I’ve had reports of individuals instructed to quarantine, those individuals have decided to do the opposite. 90% of the population don’t see this as a threat and don’t care if it spreads. The problem is our hospitals, pharmacies, funeral businesses aren’t able to cope with a 10 fold increase.If the disease spreads too quick hospitals will be flooded, many will die sitting in queues waiting for help.This is the message the government’s can’t say publicly because it will create unimaginable panic, but it is the reality we are about to face.
