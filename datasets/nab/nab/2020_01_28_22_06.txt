They also did not shroud the fact that the actual Company Secretary remains the same so it might be a thinly veiled ANN to try to sort of say nothing to see here, when it actually gives me the opposite impression.On top of the appointment of the ill-fated former AMP Chair and the recently embroiled RIO Board director, Simon McKeon to the NAB Board, it might not be the inspiration some shareholders were looking for from the new "Leadership" of Mr McEwen. Appears more of the same sorts of appointments/ resignations, trouble, boil and bubble then some other scandal comes along, perhaps?
