2019-10-04T10:50:00+10:00 : NIM is reducing through both competition (mainly for deposits) and the fact that each drop in the interest rate the bank makes less on the huge amount of deposits it has that are non interest bearing.I've sold some bank shares of late mainly due to my prediction of big NIM reductions.  dividend payout ratio is also declining and internally at the banks PC is out of control and damaging performance through underserved promotion of minorities (that includes woman). I know a switched on bloke who quit the bank as he was told he had to hire a female over his preferred candidate and since then (2 years) has established a business with offices on three countries. The overseas banks and financial service providers don't have this PC mentality and are gaining ground in some of the higher margin, no/limited capital intensive products, such as merchant acquiring and FX. I maybe wrong of course. next reporting season will be interesting
