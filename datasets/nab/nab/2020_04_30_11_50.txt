2020-04-30T11:50:00+10:00 : I remember buying Cba for around $30 in 2009 then selling for around $36 within a couple of months, thinking how clever I was, only to see it almost double within a year, I won't make that mistake again with my recent Nab purchase, I believe it will be well over $20 by the end of this year
