2020-04-06T09:52:00+10:00 : Reality still hasnt sank in. 1 million infected now.The figures are not questionable. Look at the infected in any country in lockdown. Now imagine if social distancing and community event shutdowns didnt occur.lets not be one eyed about this virus, the battle is only just beginning. “Trumps it will be done by Easter” was a statement of concern in a nation with a quarter of a million infected.Figures dont lie and this isnt a gfc. Sure nab is a good investment. But i still think we will see lower prices before this event settles.
