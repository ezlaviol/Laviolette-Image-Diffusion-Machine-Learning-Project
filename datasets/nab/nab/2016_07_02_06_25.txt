2016-07-02T06:25:00+10:00 : No one went broke making a profit as you know

I too said goodbye to my bank stock today (the trading part at least). There is something a bit unreal about the FTSE being where it is, I mean wtf guys?

There is also clearly a problem with o/s banks and insurers and so I'm betting on a bit more weakness in our banks too. Maybe another dip after the RBA holds rates is the next event to buy in after.
