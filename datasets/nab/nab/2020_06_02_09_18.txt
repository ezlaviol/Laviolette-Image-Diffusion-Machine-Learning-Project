2020-06-02T09:18:00+10:00 : Got the full amount, a extra 2120 shares. Have to admit yet again I am disappointed with NAB that allocations are already up on Computershare and the people responsible at NAB for posting up ASX announcements are late yet again in submitting their homework. Its not a good look when your children or yourself keep missing deadlines and its a sign of tardiness and lack of work ethics when you do it on a consistent basis.I mean its less than a hour to open and we are still waiting. I am not fussed as I am not selling but any other time I have participated in a SPP the allocations and the method used to calculate it are put up way in advance either on the day of closing or the day after. Its a very unprofessional look  to see your allocation on the share registry and still not have the ASX announcement put up by NAB yet. Poor form NAB, Very poor form.
