She is still going down, probably no longer the levy itself impacting the price but overall uncertainty about how banks will deal with it, add to this Trump impeachment talk, North Korea tensions, incidents like the Manchester bombing contribute to overall fear & doubt. 

Could easily drift down to $27. Could just as easily rebound to $33 we just watch and wait to see what unfolds but I try to stick to my overall philosophy of buying stocks like this when they are at or around 12 month lows. One only needs to click on the 'Y' on the HC chart (to the right) to bring up the 12 month chart.

The chart shows that $24-$25 was on offer not so long ago and anyone who has spent enough time in the market will know that price cycles can easily repeat themselves over time.
