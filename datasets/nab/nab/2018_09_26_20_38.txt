Even without it though the yield is still huge it's just less huge than before (I also understand it depends on where the shares are held and will particularly smash people with SMSF's). I could definitely see that legislation causing a material decrease in bank SP's across the board but I am not sure how warranted that would be considering they are already quite low.
