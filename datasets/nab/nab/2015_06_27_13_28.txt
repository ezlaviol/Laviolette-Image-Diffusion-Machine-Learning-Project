I have started accumulating NABHA just for this very possibility.

After reading a number of analysis articles on those lines re credit it is my view that this could represent a very safe and  good opportunity within a few years.

Am usually a spec player but have been looking to park some funds into something safer that balances the portfolio out. With the possibility of a significant return on any buy back and okay interest in the mean time I have come to this one.

Macquarie has another in a similar price range that pays slightly higher interest and is also perpetual. Have not had time yet to look into whether that could face the same issue at some point regarding Tier 1.
