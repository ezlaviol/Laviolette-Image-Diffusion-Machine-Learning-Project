Even at 44 the dividend payout is currently at 6.4% including franking credits so itâ€™s way above bank accounts return and one day it will probably get back there. Obviously not good if you need that money now, but, as I am sure that you know, you should not really be investing in the market if you can not time your exit precisely on your terms. Happy hunting.
