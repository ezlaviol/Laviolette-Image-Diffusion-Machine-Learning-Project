2020-04-02T05:35:00+11:00 : I think we do need to distinguish between Australian banks and UK banks - different organisms. UK banks are not in good shape anyway (same for most European banks it should be noted) so any connection with say NAB is tenuous at best.Having said that, there will be a hit to the next dividend - we all know that anyway. Whether NAB considers it prudent to suspend the next dividend, who knows. That is still possible.
