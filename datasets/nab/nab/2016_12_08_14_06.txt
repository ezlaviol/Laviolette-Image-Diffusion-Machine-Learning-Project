2016-12-08T14:06:00+11:00 : NAB should b about $35 IMHO.

NAB is similar to an Australian version of Bank of Montreal or Toronto Dominion as is ANZ and WBC whereas CBA is more a Royal Bank of Canada type.

The BoMs and TD Banks are going better than the CBAs/ RBCs in terms of outlook with perhaps more differentiation on the TSX than on the ASX until the earnings reports come out.
