2015-11-05T12:40:00+11:00 : Am I making a big mistake increasing my NAB position, should I be buying CBA instead despite the substantially lower divvy yield?

Fair question. I have holdings in all 4, CBA being the smallest. Historically NAB has carried the highest dividend yield and only recently been overtaken by ANZ as its share price has been crunched. Anecdotally, CBA and WBC have performed better than NAB and ANZ in the past year:
1. CBA down 7.58%
2. WBC down 10.96%
3. NAB down 17.05%
4. ANZ down 21.01%

ANZ will look even worse tomorrow when it goes ex-div.

In the past five years since the end of the GFC:
1. CBA up 54%
2. WBC up 32%
3. ANZ up 11%
4. NAB up 10%

With ANZ going ex-div tomorrow, NAB will probably leapfrog ANZ into position 3.

I think CBA has benefitted disproportionately from its status as the "darling" bank stock. Funds have it as the go-to stock when markets go up. And it is sold off less heavily when markets go down compared to the other Big 4.

In spite of this analysis, I am still likely to commit the same "mistake" as you and add to NAB or ANZ instead of CBA so you are not alone Superwealthy
