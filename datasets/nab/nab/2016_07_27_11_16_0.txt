2016-07-27T11:16:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, July 27 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand  Banking Group  (ANZ)  on Wednesday won an appeal against a  six-year long court battle over allegedly unfair credit card  charges, in a major blow to customers involved in Australia's  biggest ever class action.  	The High Court dismissed the case in which more than 185,000  Australians participated to redeem their money plus interest,  according to Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, which first issued  proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia in September 2010.  The claim size was estimated at more than A$240 million ($179.69  million).   	Customers have long complained of steep fees in Australia's  highly concentrated banking sector, with four major lenders  controlling about 80 percent of the market.  	Similar class actions are pending against eight other  lenders including No.1 National Australia Bank  (NAB)  and  second-biggest Commonwealth Bank  (CBA) , with ANZ seen as a  test case.		Australian banks reaped A$4.3 billion in service fees from  households in 2015, up 3.2 percent from a year ago, according to  latest data from the Australian Bankers' Association Inc.
