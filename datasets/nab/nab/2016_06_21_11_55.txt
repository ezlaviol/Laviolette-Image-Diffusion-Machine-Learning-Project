2016-06-21T11:55:00+10:00 : Holding >26.01 @close is very good news for NAB. Let's see where the day ends. Dow had a +250 @ one stage to pullback to 129ish @close. IMO if NAB closes >26.01 it's good news for holders that bought @27.25 

If it doesn't then idk. I wish I did. I'm wanting to buy @25!. Won't happen today by the looks of it.



GO BOQ !
