2021-05-05T18:54:00+10:00 : ANZ EPS 105cps div 70cps, payout around 67%WBC EPS 97cps div 58cps, payout around 60%CBA EPS 219cps div 150cps, payout 67%All banks EPS have rebounded to pre covid levels, which for NAB would be around $1.00 per share.I doubt NAB will do anything controversial so assuming $1.00 eps at 67% payout ratio would allow 67cps ff div.Having said that, NABs div has been higher per share historically than ANZs so here's hoping for a surprise on the upside. NAB has a lot more shares these days though.My bet.
