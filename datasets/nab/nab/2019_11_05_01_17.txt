2019-11-05T01:17:00+11:00 : banks will stay alive. but their margins are eroding and they are facing increased competition for the low calital intensive priducts which are higy sought by the banks. i see banks a bit like telcos. margins are unsustainable and technology reduces barriers to entry. dividends reducing. i sold my NAB in Sept i believe. i still hold ANZ but am not bound to that. i find Elliot (ceo) to be a better decision maker than other bank CEOs. he doesnt follow the herd and will make decisions based on retuns not sentiment (like not caving into australia post). but i do agree there are better places to leave your money than the big 4. the oy thing keeping bank shares from not collapsing is the yield against the risk free rate. but reducing dividends suggests this is shaky ground
