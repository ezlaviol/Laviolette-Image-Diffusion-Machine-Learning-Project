I bought into the banks and again in the early nineties then again around 2000 and it 2007 I threw everything but the kitchen sink into bank shares and now they are going down,when I think they have bottomed I will be buying in I may not get the timing right but at least I will be buying cheaper than last year.
I guess it a bit like dollar cost averaging but it has worked for me ,big deal if dividends go down for a few years,markets are volatile that's what they have always done and as long as you don't hold to many crap shares you come out the other side smarter.
Paying no tax is a SMFS is a bonus.
