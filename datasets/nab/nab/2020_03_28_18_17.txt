If you don't want to pay the surcharge for uber eats go the store as you say. But for many it is convenient and they are happy to pay for as such (similar in US, CVS can now deliver pharmacy scripts- a pet peeve of mine getting scripts filled often with full time work). Anyway back to NAB, reckon we may have a retest of those lows around $13. Great buying imo. Particularly coming into div season. Don't see them scrapping it. I remember GFC period I made some good money with DRP amid low prices.
