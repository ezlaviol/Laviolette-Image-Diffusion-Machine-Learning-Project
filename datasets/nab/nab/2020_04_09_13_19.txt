2020-04-09T13:19:00+10:00 : I do not believe there will be a need to raise capital.The government has in essence gauranteed 50% of small business loans and APRA have both relaxed the need for unquestionably strong as well as requesting dividends be cut.  That will reduce the need for capital at least in the short to long term.Then there is the TFF from the RBA which is 3 year money at 0.25% which is pretty much free money.  My estimate is nab will get between $10b-$12b of initial funding and being the largest commercial lender could tap the 1 for 5 RBA funding quite handsomely.
