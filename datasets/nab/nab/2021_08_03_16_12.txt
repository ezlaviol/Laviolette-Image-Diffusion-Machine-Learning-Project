Hence the old saying "only invest what your prepared to lose".My post was not to say their arent better performing stocks available on ASX. Just that the 4 pillars have a history of survivability in business, which is more than can be said about the 100,000s if not millions of businesses that have been started up and ceased since their establishment.As I said, you keep harping on about CSL. Perhaps you should go to the CSL forum and discuss the share there with other avid CSL fans. For every CSL, Amazon, Tesla, Dominos etc there is MILLIONS of stocks that try to be "growth stocks" that fall through to liquidation.The point I am highlighting here is risk tolerance. Banks = Safe Money. Growth - Risk Money. Obviously this is a risk reward issue.I could arguably make more in a 1c penny stock with a $20,000 investment than I could in CSL with the same investment, especially if the penny stock pans out to be a future CSL.
