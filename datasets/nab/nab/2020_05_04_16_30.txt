But we all come here to HC to listen what others think and what they see other respected investors are doing. You cain take it or leave it. Nobody knows where the Market is headed over the next 12 months to 2 years, and if they say they do, their a damned liar. That doesn’t mean some people won’t guess right, but that is all it will be, a guess.I am staying two thirds invested in shares even though I am prepared to see them go down appreciably, but I will focus on companies that have little debt and can keep earning profits through tough times.
