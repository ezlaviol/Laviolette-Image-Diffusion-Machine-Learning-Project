I honestly don't know where the share price will be: neither in the short term or in the medium term.Banks are inherently risky as they are effectively a leveraged link on the economy.however having said this, banks are both cheaper now and much more aware of economic weakness.so at a minimum I have a greater margin of safety compared to a year ago.but I will still keep one foot in and one foot out.if the shares go up, well I have some exposure, if share prices drop much further, well I still have cash on the sidelines.I play my shares as if I was a casino operator. I stately go  all in and prefer to play the margins.
