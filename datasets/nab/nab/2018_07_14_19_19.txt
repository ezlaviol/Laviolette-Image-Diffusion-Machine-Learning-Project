2018-07-14T19:19:00+10:00 : NAB, WBC and CBA vs American Banks, one thing sure, Royal Commission is having a big effect as can be seen in the graph. I compared NAB, WBC, CBA against C Bank of USA (Black line is AUD/USD Ratio line).
..
However, US is more driven by Tech Stocks now while ASX BANKS, Retailers & Mining makes most of the index.  
..
That's why DOW keeps surging but US Banks didn't.
