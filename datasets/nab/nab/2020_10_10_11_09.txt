Perhaps the market does not think Australia will turn off the tap to unskilled and mock skilled immigrants for the next 2-3 years like the Budget projections.I guess Australia should have some immigrants, PhDs, top executives in the C Suite, below that I think any immigration is basically unsustainable for Australia in its present form, and not much good for NAB and the other three banks unless Australia gets to a 3% real unemployment rate and participation rate falls off. Zero immigration or net emigration for the next 5 years would be very good IMHO and good for NAB and its SP IMHO.
