It is what you do after that first buy that is far more important and patience is the key. 

For me, being out of NAB, and wanting to get in for LT, I would probably take a small parcel when(if) NAB drops below 28-29. (A few more missile launches should do the trick ). And then start averaging down from there as the SP and funds permit (I am also trying to gain an exposure to that other bank). The next buy might be one to two dollars below that when and if it comes, but a slightly bigger position, and so on. If it doesn't come, then I work on  another stock I am interested in; plenty to choose from . I don't try to force the buy, though sometimes my twitching fingers get the better of me . 

Another couple of days like today, and I will be back on this bus, albeit in a small way at this stage.
