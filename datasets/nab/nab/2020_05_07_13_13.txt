2020-05-07T13:13:00+10:00 : (IMO)Whats the likelihood of the share price being less than 14.15 on trading day after May 22?    Its more likely to be above.Say its 15.15 ... if I get 2000 shares allocated then Ive made a potential (assuming I sell) profit of $2000 (less cost of selling).Is there any other way I can make 2000 using $28300?   with the same degree of low (IMO) risk?(  I do though think it more likely than not that the offer will be scaled back and number of shares allocated so that , say, nobody gets more than 1500)
