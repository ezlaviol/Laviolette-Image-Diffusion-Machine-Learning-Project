Trouble with that is,  average Joe doesn't usually realise he is average and thinks he can do better . 

Personally just holding would be little fun, and I would like to try and find out if I am better than average Joe, hence my openness with the posts. 

But yes, trying to time the market is fraught with danger and some say you will get burnt. But it is fun, so that has to have some value .
