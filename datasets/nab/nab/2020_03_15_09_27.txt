This would give more confidence in the banking sector having more cash reserves. Having small and more importantly large businesses running out of resources, example Joyce from Qantas stated they have only 6 months buffer, many businesses are not in such good position. Having so many temporary closures can only impact the banks bottom line and maintaining dividends this time may be irresponsible and if things turn out to be not so bad in 6 months, Next higher dividend payment will compensate for the one we missed this time.
