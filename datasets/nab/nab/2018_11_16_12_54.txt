2018-11-16T12:54:00+11:00 : Looking at NABs Payout Ratios, 93% 2014, 89%2015, 82% 2016, 83% 2017, 88% 2018 as of September. It appears NAB still has some space to move on this front. The few percentage points down in profit as per NAB's last report does not justify a SP reduction (working on a $30 starting point) of some 21%. This has to be a long term buy, little logic and a lot of emotional scared sentiment going on at present. I am in again @ 8.3% yeild - fully- yee hah- franked.
