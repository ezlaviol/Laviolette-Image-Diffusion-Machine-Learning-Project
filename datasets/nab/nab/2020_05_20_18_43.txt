Must be the only news outlet that said that then - ABC on Friday - and you might look at the article in * yesterday (or Monday perhaps) as well as others - all saying IO is safe and it is only discretionary items are likely to be affected.China has been threatening to get more IO from Brazil for years - and everyone knows that won't happen - Australia is a more reliable supplier.In regard to IO, China has a stimulus package for the virus and would be silly to cut off IO supplies as it will need more - and not less.

Hi FootmaxWe digress from the thread.  I said maybe and possible embargoes.   I did not say definitely.  I did read on news.com.au that China was threatening to embargo iron ore and import ore from South America.  I agree that placing an embargo on iron ore would create too much tension for China.
