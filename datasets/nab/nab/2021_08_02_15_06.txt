2021-08-02T15:06:00+10:00 : Where did I say Buffet was investing in Aussie banks?So can I ask an honest question, if NAB, ANZ, CBA and WBC collapsed tomorrow, how would the economy run?As I said, its easy to pick CSL and point out CSL as a great investment, hindsight is a wonderful thing.For every CSL there is hundreds if not 000s of "growth stocks". But for everyone 1 that makes it 100 or more do not. Even if you look at Americas top 20 companies 20 years ago, I wouldnt be surprised if none of them are the same as today.But in Australia in particular banks have been around for donkeys years so ill happily keep my money here and collect my dividend.The future looks great for NAB. As the interest rate margin increases between savers and lenders, we are set to rake in some cash.
