2017-01-11T12:39:00+11:00 : Morgan Stanley has just issued a broker note on NAB and they say that while the 2H16 result was better than forecast, their outlook on NAB has not changed materially and they continue to expect a dividend cut in FY17E. However, re- shaping the business reduces the potential capital build, which supports ROE.

MS goes on to see slowing momentum in CBA's retail banking, dilution from the corporate banking growth strategy, limited margin for error on loan losses and a potential ~$7 billion capital build. In their view, a falling ROE makes CBA vulnerable to a de-rating.

MS goes onto rate ANZ as 'overweight' (or buy), Westpac an 'equal-weight' (or hold) and the other two banks 'underweight' (or sell).
