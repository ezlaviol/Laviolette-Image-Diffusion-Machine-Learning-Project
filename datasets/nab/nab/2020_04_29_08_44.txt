These will improve in 2021 with improved economic activity (I hope).Dividends are down but not out.  Banks over the last five years have had steady dividend payouts that have been very stable.$10 in a fe wweeks is radical and you can not write any forecast like that off but it is radical.  The real issue is if you are in this now and bought years ago why would you sell now and take a loss.  I think it is better just to sit this out if you can afford to hold.
