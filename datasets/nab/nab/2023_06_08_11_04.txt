I've held a lot of bank shares for many years (unfortunately not too many CBA though) and have bought low and engaged in the capital raisings of NAB and ANZ in the last few years  They are mostly in my SMSF which for both my wife and I are in pension mode  so I shouldn't be complaining As for ANZ I totally agree, I have been with them for nearly forty years and if it wasn't too difficult to change all my  banking and share trading accounts I would flick them in an instant.
