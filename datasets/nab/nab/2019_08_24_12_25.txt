2019-08-24T12:25:00+10:00 : Well, I have mixed feelings BUT the DOW fell 600 points overnight as Trump ratchets up the Trade war and China retaliates. ASX may go down on Monday by 150-200 points - and the banks will cop a hiding as they tend to reflect sentiment changes in the market (or at least the panic selling/buying side).so, a couple of thoughts:1) the ASIC action, if won, will be a relatively small hit to NAB - RELATIVE to it's overall size of NAB and not the sanctions perhaps. The impact may not be large - and may be short lived.2) if we see bank SP's drop 2% on Monday - which is likely, then the SP becomes extremely attractive The dividend return gets up to 9% pre franking.So pain and a bit of gain - now you can toss that coin Gosh I have been liquidating some of my "spec" shares over the last week or so and I will take a punt that NAB is more than fairly priced now and if it gets below $27 on Monday, then I will get another 1,000 shares anyway.
