2020-08-04T03:16:00+10:00 : I'm all back in with my 12,000 nab shares as of Monday this week. have not been all in since early June, been trading cgf and nab. the two stocks offset each other nicely for daily trading. nab on short term lows over the full Monty (1 month - 10 years)like it was in May. a good sign for buying big and making a short term killing.
