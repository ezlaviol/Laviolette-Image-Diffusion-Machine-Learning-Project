2019-12-31T13:14:00+11:00 : well I use the ASB website for my remaining dealings in NZ. so my usage of CBA websites is due to that and is hardly anecdotal. the NABTrade anecdotal criticism is fair enough, I will concede that point to you willingly. perhaps NAB is better than I thought but I still think the CBA evidence holds both from personal experience and the Royal Commission, AUSTRAC and IBM Reports of CBA’s problems in those areas.I have my ASB relationship due to my previous NZ history. Thanks to the Ardern and Peters Government, only Kiwi, Australian and Singaporean citizens can legally own a property in NZ so I remain keenly interested in buying an Auckland Bible Belt property at say Mt Roskill when the price is right, and prices are cheaper than the equivalent areas of the North(ern) Shore of Sydney and S.E. Melbourne near the Police Academy and away from all the gangs and crime. even tho $2 million NZD or AUD is a lot of money in those parts, it probably beats apartment or duplex living in NYC (an oldee gets sick of that eventually) and New Jersey is now overpriced during the Trump Administration’s economic miracle so I will have to wait until A Democrat President and I might be unto Heaven by the time those Democrats get back in. So CBA last and I am sticking with that. But perhaps NAB is a bit more digitally able than ANZ and WBC, I probably need more evidence. I concede that.
