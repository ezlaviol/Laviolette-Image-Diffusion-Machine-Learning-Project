Sadly many small businesses will not survive and go into administration.
They can be put into "hibernation" for 6 months but after that it will take years for the economy to recover from this. Retail, tourism and the rental market will take years to recover and hence many companies will go under even after the Corona virus.

I personally think that property prices could fall at least 30% due to very high vacancy rates forcing investors to offload investment properties.

What this means for banks is their bad debts and mortgage defaults are going to be huge.
This will have a massive impact on their results like you have never seen before and it is highly likely dividends will be either massively cut or not paid.
It is inevitable that all the banks along with quite a few other bluechip companies will have to all do very large capital raising's  to restructure and strengthen their balance sheets.
Companies will be chasing limited capital so these capital raising's will have to be done at very large discounts to the company share price.

Anyone who thinks companies such as banks will be fine in six months time when the Corona Virus problem eases are going to be in for quite a shock.
Anyone buying bank shares for the dividends should be very careful as its highly unlikely these dividends will be maintained plus the future capital raising's will likely reduce their share price's quite considerably.

The banks will survive but I think there will be opportunities to buy back into them at much lower prices.
