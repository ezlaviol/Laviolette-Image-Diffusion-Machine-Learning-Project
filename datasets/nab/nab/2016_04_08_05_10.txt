2016-04-08T05:10:00+10:00 : This morning banks will drop a lot following other banks overseas. Goldman, JPMorgan drop more than 2%, Deutsche bank drop to almost record low. Wave of bankruptcies doesnt help bank either, first dick smith , and arrium..who's next? oil companies.  Superwealthy was right keep your powder dry. Bank is harder to make profit now. I'll change my limit buy to 23 from 24.
