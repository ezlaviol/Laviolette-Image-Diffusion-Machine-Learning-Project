2020-02-26T12:50:00+11:00 : I think we need to wait for all the RC issues to wash out of the system and NAB to start showing significant improvement from current strategy before we start seeing increase in Div.
The cost of the RC is ongoing and no way is it over, so there will is still some unknown expenses. In fact, in last quarterly update, the Company made this comment:-
“Customer-related remediation programs and regulatory compliance investigations (including associated enforcement actions and class actions) are continuing, with potential for additional charges although amounts and timing remain uncertain.”
It is also worth noting that nab continue to use underwriters for the Div reinvestment plans to conserve cash and hard to see any prudent reason why Div could be increased at current performance levels.
