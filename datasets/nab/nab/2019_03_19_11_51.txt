I mean big deal, it's still 7% plus franking. The div will be 0.8874c X2 per year and the current share price is $25.10. That is 7%, plus franking credits makes it 10% all up. This is on par with WBC, making them both the highest div payers of the big 4 banks. So yes finally I wont have to hear these media pundits constantly talking down NAB, constantly warning about the dreaded "div cut" and NAB can finally move on and regain the losses of last year like the other big 3 have. Now it's catch up time NAB. Get to work!
