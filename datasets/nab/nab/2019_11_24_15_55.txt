2019-11-24T15:55:00+11:00 : WBC will come down further - not in a straight line but their story is still unfolding. Other banks have been sold down as a result of WBC so they do have a chance at a  small recovery by Christmas.Investors appear to be a bit wary at the moment in case something else pops up.Banks are too important to society and the economy not to recover. Some better and faster than others. Glad I did not own shares in WBC. NAB has had its issues but I think a slow recovery may even be underway at the moment.JC - I'll park my money elsewhere for the time being. Last month or so has made me a bit over cautious

I think they all now have been smashed with the exception of CBA which seems dramatically overpriced compared to the other three. Westpac now seems the most value, all the bad governance, risk and compliance news having come out and hopefully they now fix it. NAB would appear to also be underpriced along with ANZ, provided that another governance, risk and compliance scandal does not break.NAB is almost priced for another scandal. You would hope that they were getting people in to fix it, if not could be a risky buy.i may take my chances on Monday and buy but the Board and execs of these banks seem horrific, devilish types only in it for the money and that do not learn from their own and industry errors so I do so knowing there is risk.Change my sentiment to buy from sell.
