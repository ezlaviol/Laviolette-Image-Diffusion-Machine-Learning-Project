A rising tide lifts all boats, and in terms of banks, it's only CBA and MQG that have surfed the waves well. See below NAB's capital performance relative to banks with better management cultures. Even with dividends included, the outcome was far better with CBA and MQG. Why people hold NAB is a mystery to me, but hopefully I can help holders make better decisions by pointing out how this farce of an organization is run.
