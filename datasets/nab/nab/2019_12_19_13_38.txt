Banks are regulated and if they operate outside those regulations are subject to penalties!!
Westpac, in fact, self reported at least some of the Austrac breaches, so little doubt there is actual and real cases to be held accountable for. 
To try and deflect onto the criminals that might have taken advantage of a Banks poor governance purely suggests the Banks shouldn't have to operate by the rules
Australian law enforcement agencies are always trying to catch other criminals in their nefarious activities and that is a completely separate matter.
Many go over the top in regard to what penalties should be imposed on the banks, however the actual level of penalty will no doubt take into account all of the issues.
The significant cost of remediation by all the banks for the various instances of poor customer treatment is also proof there was serious problems with Bank governance. 
I haven't seen anyone blaming the everyday bank employee, however there is very good reason for there to be anger at executives who are highly paid however lack accountability.
Government regulatory bodies also have to have a good look at themselves however they have an easy out by just saying they have been underfunded 
Easiest way for the banks to move forward is to clean up their governance and processes, not try and win a media war by blaming others........
