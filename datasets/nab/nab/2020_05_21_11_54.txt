2020-05-21T11:54:00+10:00 : I'm anticipating this spp will raise $1.1 -1.4 billion based on 15-20% shareholder participation putting in average of $12.5k, but if the average application is $15k (which seems less likely), then they might get up to $1.7 billion.In any case, I doubt there will be a scale back and the bank will, more than likely, want the lot (all oversubscriptions were accepted in the previous ANZ, CBA, WBC, BOQ spp raisings, but not NAB), even if they get $2billion, to fortify their position during this economic uncertainty ...but do your own research.In the unlikely scenario of NAB repeating their previous history of giving their retail shareholders a piddling amount (I.e. $500mill), then I think it will be scaled back pro rata to shareholders' holdings.I do not intend to stag this one because the profit is likely to be small, and it's not certain you can buy them back below $14.15 in the near future.  And It's a big risk to hold these shares until 3rd June, when they become tradable, if you are relying on a stag.... so I plan to patiently hold.
