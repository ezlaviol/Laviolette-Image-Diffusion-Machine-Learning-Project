2019-12-22T13:45:00+11:00 : All good points 600ml.A lot of people don't trust on-line banking - maybe that is a generation thing. Also, there are elements of banking (loans for example) where both sides prefer a face to face negotiation. I can't see that changing doo much in the next few years. To be honest, I refused to use an ATM until about three years ago - since that time I have only visited a bank to make the (only too rare) deposit.I agree with you - I think we will see less branches but we may see downsized branches rather than a wholesale culling of branches. The take up of almost purely on-line banking, maybe added to what I mentioned before about a cashless society, will see branches being advisory points rather than what they have been which is a cash handling facility.

The last Friday before xmas, when most businesses shutdown for two weeks is probably going to be busy regardless of the number of branches.I wouldn't use observations on that day as a measurement of demand for teller services, or a justification for keeping branches open.I'd say most bank branches are dead for the majority of business hours of the week, and branches should probably be measured on a metric like sales per square metre. The ones that don't stack up can be reduced, particularly if they are in close proximity to other branches, then only keep the ones with the best access to parking, transport and other nearby services so a bank visit can be incorporated into customers' routines for convenience.In fact, I'd say it's better to close most and instead measure whether it is more effective to be open on Saturday morning, in order to serve more customers and do more business. It doesn't add to the bank's fixed costs to have an existing branch open on Saturday morning.It's hard to think of many bank services that require teller/face-to-face contact any more? (and do they actually generate revenue for the bank?)
