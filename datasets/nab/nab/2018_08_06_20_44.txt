..
Life Insurance Fee charged by MLC is fraction relative to what I pay for my life insurance to other superfund.
..
I am MLC Master Key Gold Star (Australian Equity Shares) (Formerly known as All Equity). This years (2017-18) was 14.1%. Last years (2016-17) return was 9.53%
..
Honestly I think those are excellent returns by any standard.
