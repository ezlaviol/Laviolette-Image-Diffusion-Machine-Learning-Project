Half year profit $2.856 Billion +15.8%. Not sure what was expected but pretty happy with the Dividend:)This is what was expected by Credit Suisse:So cash earnings were $3.15 billion compared to $3.2 billion. Sounds close enough. Cash EPS was 131 cps compared to 137 expected. A miss. Dividend was 99 cps compared to 103 expected. Another miss.I think the UK bad conduct charges caused a good portion of this fall. Also it seems that the other Big 4 are growing at the expense of NAB. Particularly ANZ in business banking. NAB's earnings have been jogging on the spot for about two years now.
