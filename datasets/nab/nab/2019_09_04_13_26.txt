2019-09-04T13:26:00+10:00 : Why do NAB prefer to.lend with implied support of APRA to AfterPay but limiting lending to home buyers is my question? What is the reasoning and connection between NAB & AfterPay? If an individual went to NAB to borrow $300 million and losing so much money would NAB lend them money?Would NAB lend $300,000 to any homebuyer who was experiencing a cashflow deficit in proportion to the $300 million AfterPay is paying in expenses ? No APRA forbids it yet is turning a blind eye to $30,000 and under X 7.6 million people. Would this not pose a bigger banking risk to our economy than banks lending extra to home buyers? I'm not complaining about NAB here , I'm discussing all banks being denied ability to.be more lenient to home buyers yet it's ok for AfterPay but not Credit Cards for similar amounts seems contradictory. You probably can't see the risks to the economy and all the banks and I'm not trying to scare anyone and certainly I'm not scaring you so my comments are not going to move the ASX in any direction as this is all theoretical until we get more answers from APRA & NAB and that is most unlikely at this stage. ZipPay on.other and is owned in part by Westpac so there is some reciprocal benefit in lend money to zip but what's in it for NAB? Is it extra pay bonuses for staff for landing such a good big borrower ? What the profit margin benefit for NAB? Does anyone know?
