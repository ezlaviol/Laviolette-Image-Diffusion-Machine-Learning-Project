If things settle down and dividends are maintained - and I can get the shares reasonably cheaply - 20-24 sort of range, then I may hang on to them.At the moment I have a limited number of options with companies that I would like to invest in.If things are unsettled then I will take the step of taking my profits.I used to be welded into keeping certain shares but I have sort of changed that strategy a bit.
