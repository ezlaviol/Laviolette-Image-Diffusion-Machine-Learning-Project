Now We know, Thorburn was interviewed by police last Feb - over a year ago. Thorburn knew well where the dirty washing lay, he should never have fronted the AGM in December. Pity us little shareholders in a bank that claimed it was more than money. Shame on Henry and Thorburn! Please, a genuine bank now.
