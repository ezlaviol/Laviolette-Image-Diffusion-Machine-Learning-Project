In fact it had all time highs over $40 around end 2007 and lowest it went during GFC was about $16................................(so something dodgy has got into that chart!!)
Of course this is no doubt the point the op was trying to make.
Obviously if you invested everything at all time highs return hasen't been brilliant but if you bought during GFC then return is very good and all through NAB has paid a good divvy..........................
