I was planning on buying on a dip with some bad news (of which I'm sure there is/will be plenty). I couldn't see any reason that would spike the SP 20% other than a vaccine...but of course I was wrong... The stock market is a strange an unpredictable beast...I just don't get it (and that is my problem)...I walk down the street and there are so many closed shops, so many empty shops. Unemployment is massive, China is playing games, mortgage deferrals due to come off, property market exposure...all tells me down not up...urghhhhh
