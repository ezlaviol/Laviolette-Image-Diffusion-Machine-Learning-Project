2020-06-04T08:16:00+10:00 : no one was certain on the effects of the pandemic on retail holders which is why the underwriters would have pushed NAB plus NAB not wanting risk, to go institutions to raise the funds right now. I get the move. I would have done the same as a risk mitigation strategy.If all the banks raised at the same time you would have maybe seen not such a high uptake. Another risk, which explains why NAB bought forward its results as a surprise to raise quickly. However it didn’t realise the other banks didn’t need to raise. I guess their new ceo has less risk tolerance given his experience in Europe crisis. Also NABs more business lending than the others which are residential.
