I noticed that drop in CBA following the RC mention. It's amazing how closely the banks mirror each others movements.

A lot of volatility in today's prices, it'll be interesting to see what they all close at.

Surprised to see all but CBA bounce this afternoon - CBA seems to be by far the biggest loser so far in relation to the RC.

Mark.
