2020-03-14T10:23:00+11:00 : One thing sure, DOW latest recovery is going to be very very short lived as we have seen last several recoveries during last two week. One day recovery and crashing down next day. Has happened three or four times in two weeks...Look at GFC, market hit bottom on 2008 while GFC was at is peak Mid of 2007. Market hit rock bottom 12 months after GFC started as losses started flowing through...My biggest worry is ETF going bankrupt and dragging the market along with it.
