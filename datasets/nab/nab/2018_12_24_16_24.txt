2018-12-24T16:24:00+11:00 : I left the AGM with the sense that Ken Henry managed bad news skilfully - but that is only a comment on his people skills at the AGM. I'd rather have seen banker's skills from him - instead he claimed those resided in Andy Thorburn. Unconvincing, Henry. (Andy did not speak a lot and then only in defence of the past.) And so neither gentleman set forth a plan for SP recovery. But it got worse, Anne Loveridge was re-elected on Henry's mansplaining say-so. Not good enough, Henry. And while the Board has obviously been sleeping at the wheel this last 24 months, it fell to this AGM for Ms Loveridge's re-election, the only election to the Board this year. Ms Loveridge's skills in this year of the Royal Commission? Wait for it,  she claims skills in compliance and risk management - and that she has commendable service on the NAB Nomination and Governance Committee! She even has vast experience in financial and regulatory reporting … etc etc. So where was she this last two years? Where are the documents detailing her anger at the Bank's processes? And why did NAB put her forward with such strong evidence against the nomination? (I could same the same for several Board members but they weren't up for nomination …) If only the bank could be forward looking, conservative and well-led! That just might let me vote in favour of the REM report next year.
