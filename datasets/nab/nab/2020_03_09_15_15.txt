2020-03-09T15:15:00+11:00 : Thanks for the info on DOW futures.I have an order in at $20 just in case we see a huge fall again tomorrow. Figure at $20, there won't be too much downside in the medium term - maybe just some short term pain.

More important will be what the DOW does tonight. I believe DOW futures is down something like 4% which is what started todays out of control dump in Australia. If the DOW fall doesn't happen or it recovers from a terrible start like it did on Friday, we may have a big reversal tomorrow. I'm buying for the mid/long term anyway so I'm not too concerned about what Victorian sellers may do. A public holiday in one state shouldn't stop people buying or selling through any of the online traders anyway.
