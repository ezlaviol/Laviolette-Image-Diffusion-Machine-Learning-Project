2016-07-06T16:20:00+10:00 : ashwon your on the money mate, yield will win out in the end on NAB in my personal opinion, at these sp levels its near 8% return, highest returns of all the banks, were the hell does one even get close to that return especially with global interest rates at record lows, most central banks at zero

surely at these levels this is a no brainer, also once the election passes over and hopefully libs win surely there has to be a slight spike in nab sp

this has to be a pretty damn good buy at these levels, nab wass don near 50cents today and then you sen the buyers come in and see value and push it up to only down some 14 cents.

even if you bought at these levels and it pulled back another dollar still one of the best yielding stocks at the minute and good for a long term hold.

am I missing something here????
