2020-04-14T10:09:00+10:00 : Of the 7 brokers included in FNArena, only the Macquarie summary mentions the possibility of a capital raise and then only if the "worst case scenario" emerges in which case the "banks would need to "aggressively" reduce their dividend, and potentially raise $5-10bn on top, each."FWIW, my expectation is heavy cuts to dividends by all 4 banks this year but no capital raise. Current plan is to take the DRP.
