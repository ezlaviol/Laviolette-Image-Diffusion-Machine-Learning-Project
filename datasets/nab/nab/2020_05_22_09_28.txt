In this case, you'd want to make sure you're getting a fair price for selling off that slice - represented by shares of the company - of the business. It would make no sense for NAB to issue, say,1 billion shares at $14 for example, because even though they 'get' $14b dollars through this exercise, the existing owners of the ~3billion shares now own only 75% of NAB, instead of 100%. Obviously disadvantageous for existing nab holders, given its NTA is well above $14 and its market value was $28 just a few months ago. It's for this reason that there's a strong disincentive for NAB management to not increase the SPP offering size by too much, if at all.
