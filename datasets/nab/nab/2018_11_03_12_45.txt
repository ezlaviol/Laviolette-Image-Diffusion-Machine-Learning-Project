The property market is falling in Sydney so of course investors will hold off knowing they can buy cheaper in 12 months. There will be fewer loans overall. Of course this slow per must come to an end due to 100000 people a year coming in to Sydney and they have to live somewhere. I think if you are looking to invest to hold off at the moment. In 12 months but back at a lower price
