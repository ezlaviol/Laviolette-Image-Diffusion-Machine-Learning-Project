As a measure of the big 4+1 last time they had SPP. Westpac late last year wanted $500M they got $700M and ate it all no scaleback. Single digit discount. Macquarie 3Q last year wanted $600M got $679M and ate it all no scaleback. Double digit discount. Also fair to keep in mind usually only up to 50% of retail participates in capital raisings. For instance only 45% participated in Cochlearâ€™s raise when the discount was 25%. There is still a chance of scaleback but why pass up a chance at free money? If the discount is double digit why are we even discussing the semantics of scalebacks?
