2017-11-30T19:28:00+11:00 : us money is moving from tech to banks, australian banks should follow suit. the fact this is bank initiated is a positive as seen by todays close (against all odds and a sign of strength on a down day), the inquiry isnt going to happen overnight either. Taking out the uncertainty should have this bounce, i am looking for 30.51 in the next few days...

long term - im not a fan of banks
