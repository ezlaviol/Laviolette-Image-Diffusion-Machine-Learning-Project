Probably can buy more at cheaper price after,  that's if I want to.
The sharemarket is way too risky right now.

Oh, and the Banks do belong to the shareholders, it's not the "hated" Banks losing money, but the shareholders, who have invested their hard earned.
It's  really not fair, that we are the one losing capital and income, because of defaults, and bankrupt individuals (some of them very irresponsible, but of course not all) and companies, even though I am not blaming anyone.
It's all a very unfortunate situation.

How is the government going to help us, the shareholders, losing more than 60% of our income. on top of losing capital.
How about the self-funded retired people, the ones who planned their retirement very carefully, but now have been hit really hard, in every way.
Are they going to get help? 
No, I don't think so.
