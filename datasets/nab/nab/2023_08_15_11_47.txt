2023-08-15T11:47:00+10:00 : Something has to be done about it. The accounts are atrocious. the non Big 4 are not really any better but at least their scandals impact them greatly.BDO’s reputation is a mess after it’s Braemar Shipping scandal.PKF is a mess down in Australia with the Clubs NSW money laundering den scandal.But why do NAB still have EY doing their audits?How can you take an EY set of audited accounts seriously?Where is the provision for money laundering both for BNZ as investigated and penalized by RBNZ, and the Australian bank by AUSTRAC?
