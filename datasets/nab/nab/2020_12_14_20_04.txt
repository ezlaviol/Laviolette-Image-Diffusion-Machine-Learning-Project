2020-12-14T20:04:00+11:00 : The too big to fail theory continues I think banks have been scrutinized so much over the last few years with royal commission and break up of other sections within banks - financial planning, insurances etc...Its at a point now some are seeing just how overly red-taped it is and ignoring "customers first" approach.An old man trying to drawn on his own home,A gambler trying to access moneyBanks being forced to inform customers when better loan deals are availableI mean common....... If you imposed any of this stuff on other industries they would be out of business.For example:"Oh sir just letting you know your 2020 new car is no longer the best deal we have on offer we are soon to be rolling out the 2021 new car deal which is faster and more fuel efficient. Just thought id inform you in case you would like to change over........"What happened to business being business???????? The banks need a run for the confidence of capitalism!
