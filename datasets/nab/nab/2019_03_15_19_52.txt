2019-03-15T19:52:00+11:00 : I'm back in today, granted only a small parcel ~$3k for my first purchase but (for my circumstances) seems like a reasonable point to start a long position with the intention of holding for many years.I'm a former long term holder and have bought and held at various times between $24.10 -$35.60 per share.Will be interesting to see how the company manages with a new CEO and Chairman and whether they maintain the dividend, I'm feeling confident.
