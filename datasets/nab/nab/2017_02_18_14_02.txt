Think about RIO and BHP - they are both near 12 months highs, but if you think that it is structural with China wanting to limit pollution and BHP and RIO have the high quality, low polluting assets, then buying BHP and RIO, even now, may be a good bet. (considering the cash they are throwing off, this good be a good move.) 12 month highs do not always lead to falls.
