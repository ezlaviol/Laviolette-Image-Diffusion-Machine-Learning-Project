Of course there is no single solution to the housing problem but those above trashing your argument seem to me to be deliberately blind of your argument. For example Rona immediately jumps to the extreme end of the argument and site and argues the likes of Packer would benefit, when it takes so little imagination to consider your idea could be means tested (capped) to avoid 'excess' arguments. Making it easier for working people and the young to enter the housing market would be for the benefit of the total market, especially in combination of stamp duty removal, reduction of red tape and a variety of other measures. Well done for standing up against the storm
