2020-04-28T12:09:00+10:00 : The pandemic is not the point. NAB and any prudently managed institution should have planned for a crisis of some sort after learning from the pain of the GFC. If it wasn't COVID, it would be something else and NAB would be in the same position - cutting dividends and diluting shareholders yet again. What could NAB have done? Not paid out an unsustainable level of dividends especially in the midst of a Royal Commission, a surge in regulatory fines pre-dating that and planned for an inevitable economic shock because something or the other would happen. We don't live in la-la land where you can simply pay out all your profits as dividends and not have any buffers. How could they have done that? Dropped payout ratios significantly so that it had the capital to withstand an inevitable shock, not disappoint shareholders by then cutting dividends and raising money, and they could have certainly done so to meet and preferably exceed APRA's 'unquestionably strong' metric which they have dragged their heels on.
