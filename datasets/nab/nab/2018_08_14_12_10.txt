2018-08-14T12:10:00+10:00 : Generally a better result than I was expecting in terms of earnings, credit impairment and by all metrics except:1. higher compliance costs: as banks continue to serve duty as the politicians' favourite punching bags, I do see this as an ongoing drag on performance; and2. the lower capital ratios need to be looked at and  I hope management will address this issue before the end of the current financial year (or, at least, announce plans to do so).
