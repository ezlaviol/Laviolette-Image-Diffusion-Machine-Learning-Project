2023-08-04T07:09:00+10:00 : we can't foresee corrections but safe to say there had to be a pullback at some point.other than anz hitting that resistance line all banks still looking in a favourable uptrend.on a tangent IO's recent pull back is making the miners kook attractive once again.i am 70% cash and waiting for a bigger pullback this year. NAB happy to take the div and stay with what i have unless it goes sub $26.2for me a sell at $29+
