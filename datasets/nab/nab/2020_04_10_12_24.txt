2020-04-10T12:24:00+10:00 : As some have said; the results for this half have been relatively strong.Take a step back: mortgage market was improving over the last 6 months - higher house prices and more turnover/credit growth.NAB is fully in a position to pay a dividend, how much it heeds APRA's directive I guess we'll see. Last I checked we weren't entirely socialist so company's still had some discretion.And even it they don't pay a dividend, the money won't be lost per se. Part of the reason companies like google, FB etc do so well SP wise is because they don't pay out dividends. Any dummy spit by dividend fixated investors may be a good opportunity to buy more shares.Unless bad loans have really spiked (and I'm not sure how they would with all the government intervention/support and bank loan holidays) the share prices of the banks have been oversold in my opinion.NAB lost half its SP in a matter of weeks ($26 to $13), that was more intense selling even than the GFC which was a bona fide credit crisis with legitimate concerns over housing and bank funding. Interesting times. DYOR.
