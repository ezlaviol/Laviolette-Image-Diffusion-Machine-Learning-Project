2020-03-14T16:08:00+11:00 : 1 single event has lead to 150,000 infections spanning across 130 countries within 3 months? Under control? Huh.That would mean in 3 months if it continues to spread at the same rate would see 22,500,000,000 cases. It is in 130 countries, are all countries going to contain it. China hasn’t been able to contain it, slowed yes but contained no way. Remember what just 1 event can lead to?7% chance of death direct from the virus.How many indirect deaths? How many people are dying from preventable things because the health services are too busy dragging bodies out of nursing homes.A bit worse then woolies running out of bog roll.Australia already has horribly slow ER’s/hospitals throw a 1000,000 corona patients in the mix we are stuffed.our approach will contain it and slow it down. Instead of running through the worlds population in 2-3 months, it’ll run for the next 6 - 12 months.
