2018-11-21T19:30:00+11:00 : it's good to see a favourable SP . 

I have only recently commenced trading and thought NAB would be a great place to start so got in at a couple of buys in the last 4 Days and very happy with the price , given the yield and the potential for growth , these IMHO are a hold and should see upward move .

When I look at 12 months history on SP I feel they may present similar to CBA ( given previous SP on both and the yield is better on NAB ]

Thinking of buying more even though they have moved over 24.00 mark 

Happy trading everyone
