2020-09-06T11:44:00+10:00 : Anyone buying Banks or thinking about it should really think twice.There is no way a V shape recovery is going to happen.The only reason why the share market is still holding is because of all the stimulus.If they hadn't provided Job Keeper, the economy would have already fallen off a cliff.Without Job Keeper people won't be able to pay there ridiculous mortgages.As soon as the job keeper is reduced the slide is going to begin. Our economy is built off a housing Ponzi scheme and the Politicians and Economists know it. it is very sad what is going to happen at the start of next year and alot of people are going to get burnt.The true unemployment and underemployment figure is being hidden by Job Keeper. Banks are going to be crushed again along with the share market.
