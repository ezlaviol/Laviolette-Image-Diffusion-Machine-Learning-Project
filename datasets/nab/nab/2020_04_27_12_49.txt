The banks are very well capitalised and always retain sufficient funds required, while also returning a fairly high proportion to shareholders in Dividends which incidentally also assists the economy and reduces reliance on Government support.
I agree bonuses are too high (in Corporates full stop) but hardly is the real issue at present.
The Australian Banking system is also one of the very important contributors to Aus taxation and any assistance by Gov is usually not a large impost and more directed at the end user. 
We are fortunate that we have a banking system that doesn't need bailing out by our Government which the GFC reinforced.
It is however a public Company and capital requirements change from time to time.
An event such as a major close down of many businesses in Australia due a global pandemic is not one you would structure a balance sheet around even though the capital backing is there to safeguard against most events!
