I understand that H/Loans form a major part of NAB's loan book, however my point is Aus banks are not building societies and have a lot more irons in the fire. (Investsmart's comments relate to purely the loan book)
From NAB's 2017 annual report - break up of assets which form part of NAB's business and break up of Cash earnings across the segments (obviously will be some crossover - but I think you get my point):-
