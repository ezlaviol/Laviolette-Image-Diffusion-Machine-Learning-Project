Ludicrous to think that McEwan's statements will "repair his impairments"!!
Warning people in to deep that they might be better off taking what equity they have now is simply stating the obvious. (And of course he doesn't want mass selling by NAB customers!!)
As I said earlier unfortunately very few will listen, so will have sfa impact on his impairments and the situation will run it's ultimate course
