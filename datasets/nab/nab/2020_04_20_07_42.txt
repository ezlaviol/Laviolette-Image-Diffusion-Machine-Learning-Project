2020-04-20T07:42:00+10:00 : Recent update re. if we have seen low yet in the SP and overall ASX due to the horrific drop in economic activity due to Covid-19:-

"Other well-known fund managers, including Platinum Asset Management boss Andrew Clifford, have warned recent share market gains would likely be short-lived. Platinum's $10 billion flagship International Fund fell seven per cent in March and 11 per cent in the first three months of the year.

“Our short-term view is that markets are likely to return to the lows of March and possibly fall further as markets continue to grapple with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic,” Mr Clifford wrote on Thursday. "
