After that it is 1 for 14 shares (As per SPP guidelines)..So if you had 1400 shares, and you applied for $5,000 then you will receive 176 plus 100 shares (1 for 14) i.e. 276 shares...Rest of 1100 dollars will be returned to you some times during mid June but within current financial year...Will refund be via Bank Cheque or direct credit, no idea about it.
