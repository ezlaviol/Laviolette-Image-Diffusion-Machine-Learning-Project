2016-01-05T18:56:00+11:00 : Just had a phone call from NAB. Re the brick they sent us on the demerger. Well.... apparently it WAS read by Buckleys  and the demerger is in trouble unless they get shareholders to respond to the resolution. Luckily the worms don't need feeding and it's sitting on my desk unopened, I suppose I have to do my democratic thing.
Now it's your turn.
Cheers.
