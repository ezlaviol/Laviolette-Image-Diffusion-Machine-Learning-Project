2020-03-12T11:49:00+11:00 : Well I'm back in with another trade at an average of 19.19. With my trade 2 days ago I'm not sitting at about 19.40 overall entry price. I am reasonably comfortable with that. I imagine that on ex dividend date we might see another buy opportunity as NAB will get oversold.
