2015-06-06T17:31:00+10:00 : I think NAB really needs to deal with a bad operation in the UK - it has been souring sentiment on NAB for years, so I think they just need to get rid of it even if they give it away for free at least it will be gone and the market can then refocus on the EPS, decent profits and decent divvy. Has been left in the dust by the better performing banks.
