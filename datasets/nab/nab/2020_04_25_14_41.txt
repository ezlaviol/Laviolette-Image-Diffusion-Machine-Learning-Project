But opening too soon and going into isolation again would be a disaster.I think if we wait the 3 weeks and have a ramped up restart with social distancing, testing and keeping on top of it there may be strong light at the end of the tunnel and the banks will rebound strongly.In the meantime within 3 weeks I expect there to be some shocks coming from the US, maybe a 5-7% fall on 1-2 days and the opportunity to buy when our market follows theirs because that is what it seems to do.
