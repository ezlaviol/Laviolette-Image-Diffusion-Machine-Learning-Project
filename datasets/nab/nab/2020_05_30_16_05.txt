Pro and cons in both.in summary, if classified stocks as:asset - similar to when you buy an investment property, some costs such as brokerage would form part of your capital cost, but some costs such as interest can be claimed against your salary and other income, under negative gearing (if you had borrowed to purchase shares)- able to utilise the cgt discount.trading stock - no cgt discount, similar to a milk bar who buys stock and sells, the full profit is taxed.any loss can be used to reduce income such as salary.generally if you are in the business of share trading then you would classified stock as Trading stock.Meaning you would be conducting share trading activities as if you running a business.I hope this helps
