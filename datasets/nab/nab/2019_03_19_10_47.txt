The report is about 5 weeks old though and predictions are just that, predictions. Interestingly, SP has gone up 70 cents since the report so maybe there is nothing in it.

This broker must of had the inside wordhttps://www.********.au/2019/02/13/top-broker-predicting-nab-to-cut-its-dividend-by-16-this-year/Even with a 16% drop, I think it is still a solid choice.
