So what you're really saying is that I have to keep listening to brokers and pundits warning us off NAB  Damn you NAB you tricked me  Though I really do hope both ANZ and NAB move the payments into this financial year. Still haven't recovered all of late last year's losses. Div payment in June will help that problem.
