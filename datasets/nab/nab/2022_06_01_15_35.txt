2022-06-01T15:35:00+10:00 : From the DRP rules [https://www.nab.com.au/about-us/shareholder-centre/dividend-information/dividend-reinvestment-plan-and-bonus-share-plan-terms-and-conditions]:"Where the application of the formula .... results in a fractional entitlement, the fractional entitlement will be carried forward to the Participantâ€™s Plan account, without interest, to be applied towards the calculation at the time of the next dividend. The Directors have the discretion to determine that any residual positive balances will be paid to Participants (either by direct credit or cheque) where, in the opinion of the Directors, it would be unlawful or impractical for these balances to be carried forward to the next dividend. The amount carried forward (if any) will be detailed in the Plan Statement referred to in clause 16.After a person ceases to be a Participant in the DRP (Former Participant), and the balance (if any) of their Plan account exceeds AUD $10, NAB will either pay this balance into any Australian, New Zealand or U.K. bank account nominated by the Former Participant (amounts cannot be paid into other foreign bank accounts), or alternatively provide payment by cheque. Residual balance payments will be made annually. Residual amounts of AUD $10 or less will automatically be donated to ShareGift Australia."When you receive your statement (usually on the payment date) it will detail any amount brought forward from the previous DRP (in your case, nil), and the amount to be carried forward to the next DRP.
