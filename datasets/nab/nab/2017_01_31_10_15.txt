2017-01-31T10:15:00+11:00 : (Adds details)  	Jan 30 (Reuters) - British lender CYBG Plc  CYBGC.L , home  of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, said on Monday its  first-quarter net interest margin was unchanged from a year  earlier, in line with its expectations, as asset yields came  under pressure.  	The lender said net interest margin in the three months  ended Dec. 31 was flat at 222 basis points, and that its trading  in the period was in line with its expectations.  	"As expected, asset yields came under pressure from the  start of the period following the August 2016 base rate  reduction, along with increased competition in retail lending  markets," CYBG said.		"We saw the benefits of deposit repricing begin to offset  these pressures towards the end of the period, alongside other  measures to reduce funding costs, including a modest drawdown on  the Bank of England Term Funding Scheme in December."  	The challenger bank said its overall deposit balances was  27.3 billion pounds ($34 billion) as at Dec. 31, up 4.7 percent  on an annualised basis compared with Sept. 30, driven by both  business and personal accounts.  	CYBG, which was spun off from National Australia Bank   (NAB) , said its mortgage book was 22.1 billion pounds as at  Dec. 31, a growth of 4.4 percent on an annualised basis.  	The lender's common equity tier one capital ratio - a key  measure of financial strength - increased to 12.8 percent as at  Dec. 31 from 12.6 percent as at Sept. 30.  	The company said 574 million pounds ($716 million) worth of  its lending was to small and medium-sized businesses in the  first quarter.  	CYBG, which is targeting more than 100 million pounds of  sustainable cost reductions by 2019, said it was on track to  record underlying costs of 690 million to 700 million pounds  this fiscal year.  	The company also maintained its other forecasts for fiscal  2017, including that net interest margin would be broadly flat  with the year earlier.   ($1 = 0.8016 pounds)
