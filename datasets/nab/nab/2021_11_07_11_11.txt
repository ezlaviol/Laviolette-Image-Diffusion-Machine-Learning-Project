2021-11-07T11:11:00+11:00 : Anyone have an idea about what costs figures are expected to be on Tuesday? Look what has happened to Westpac’s share price some say largely due to putting on new staff and a lack of transparency on a costs reduction path. The shorters may be gearing up tomorrow but we (most of us anyway I suppose) won’t know until T tomorrow plus 4 what tomorrow’s short interest is.
