2020-03-13T01:31:00+11:00 : @rvajnaStory time:So there I was in Dec 2008.The stockprice of Mastercard had been hammered from 30 USD/share to 13 USD!My american friend from Cleveland swirled his chair around and blurted out: 'Seriously dude, you're going to invest in credit cards at times of despair like this!?  Hope you ready to get slaughtered buddy.Why would anyone buy into the financial sector now!' You fool!  Before the end of the year Mastercard recovered to 25 USD/share then higher highs over the years that followed., 35, 70,  200 and peaked at 350 USD a share in the rally that we saw.  yea it doesn't 'feel' good to buy on the dips as you go against the herd mentality and you can't pick the bottom.Money is made when blood runs in the street and not when the economy is humming along fabulously. Let me revisit this thread on the 12 of March 2022 and see if the stock price is above or below $18.33 I'm buying with both hands.
