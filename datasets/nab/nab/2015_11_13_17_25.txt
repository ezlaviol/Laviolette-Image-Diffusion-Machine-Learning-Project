2015-11-13T17:25:00+11:00 : The DRP? Oh the DRP!


Yep, I put forward my case as to why I thought it was a silly strategy risking so much, as have others. It took me a while to understand the importance of capital preservation, let's just say I've paid my dues.

As I stated earlier, even without brokerage it's 5%. I'm not making $100k trades anyway, so not really in any position of authority to speak about orders of that size which is why I asked if they'd actually done it?
(as  yet still not answered)

However if you were trying to time the market, on days like today when there's a big broad move down you'd be blown up. It gapped down on open so no trading strategy aside from selling yesterday afternoon would have been spared. From what I saw he's picked the high and low off a historical graph and come up with some numbers which I have rebutted.

My preference is to accumulate and compound over a long period, thus getting a CGT discount of 50% (Capital Gains Tax) because one can rarely pick the low and then the high consistently.

Happy to hear your thoughts.
