2018-06-06T11:08:00+10:00 : Rising interest rates should increase NIM (the spread between cost of funds and interest charged on loans) although in the short term the benefit will be offset to a greater or lesser extent by mark-to-market losses on debt securities held on balance sheet.

As an investor, the most important question for me is NAB's ability to maintain dividends in the short/medium term and to resume increasing them over the longer term.

FWIW, consensus forecast  from FNArena is for DPS to drop to AUD1.909 in FY2019 (down from AUD1.98) off slightly higher EPS.  That's a yield of around 7.1%. If that's the worst of the damage the current issues generate, IMHO NAB represents good long term value for people looking for income. (Of course, there are better growth opportunities elsewhere.)
