I understand you are factoring in divvy returns and the DRP stock you have accumulated, but surely a priority of investing is to protect ones capital and (hopefully) in fact grow the capital in addition to any additional divvy.

Of course you could have plonked the cash in a term deposit, compound the interest and probably done as well or better than NAB and this in fact illustrates how bad NAB has been IMHO.
