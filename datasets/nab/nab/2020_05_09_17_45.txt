WBC isn't an applicable case as the market price approached the SPP price and didn't trade at a premium as is the case here. The ANZ example from 2009 is more similar in terms of how far the offer is in the money. But I think that 30K limit will make a difference and although it was in effect for WBC, it wasn't a factor in the ANZ example. I wouldn't be surprised if this raised $3B or more and I don't think NAB directors will stomach that kind of dilution.
