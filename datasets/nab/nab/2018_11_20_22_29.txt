But what I think is happening the banks are being pushed into a corner with tighter lending to push the price far enough so first home buyers can buy.

Soooooo many people I know are waiting with $$$ in the bank to buy property, there will probs be a boom in first home buyers if it goes lower.

Government would want prices low so they can profit of the stamp duty... so they have an agenda.

I'm not worried about Brexit, trump or oil prices I'm only worried if labour wins.

Once they win I'll probably be investing in water as that's what's going to be needed to put out the flames.

This is my opinion only guys.
