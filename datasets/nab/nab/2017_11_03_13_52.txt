2017-11-03T13:52:00+11:00 : Good ann, bad ann ???  Everybody trying to figure out why the mk is doing what the mkt is doing.

Imo, we are still in the institutional re-weighting that started in early May (just before the bank levy news), with the rapid fall from $34 to $29, then the gradual upward trend of seesaw action....until ~6 weeks ago.  From then it was a nice smooth ride up to FY results ann, although imo capped/manged from breaching $33.  I was expecting seesaw all the way.  

FY results ann yesterday and bang, opened 99c lower than the previous close, exact amount of the final divvy.....funny thing that. 
If the fall on open was a general dissatisfaction with the result and going forward, the loading of the sells would have been pushing the opening sp down from well before trading commenced....it did not!  It was a sudden and swift loading of the sells just minutes before it opened.

Did anyone notice that ANZ behaved in exactly the same manner on it's FY results ann last week?  People also tried to pinpoint why, although they might've had an easier job there.  My first impression was because they were a constricted anus with their divvy!

Anyway, on the basis of what we have seen with these two, my prediction is for WBC to behave exactly the same way on Monday.
