2018-12-03T14:14:00+11:00 : Even in global financial crisis in 2008, NAB traded around $20; What would you expect it now.And NAB is the least exposure to the property market.I have switch part of my holding to NAB as NAB has lower trading fees than the rest 4 big banks.I would expect a big bounce back to $26 and above is soon to come.IMHO
