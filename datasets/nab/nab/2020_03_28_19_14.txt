However, it would be a load of BS and you would be best to follow your own advice.The fall in the US market last night, and if I read it right a future prediction of a similar fall, it could take a hit Monday and Tuesday.I think without analysis it will fall for the next 4 weeks by a significant amount but then pick up as I think it will be fine in the long run.I have been very pessimistic but on reading some of the latest information, maybe it will be over in the next 3 months, or at least from the economic point of view.Based on I am thinking that the real fatality rate may be more 0.5-0.6% rather than 1%.  And that the asymptomatic cases may be more widespread and that we may get herd type immunity earlier.
