2019-11-12T17:57:00+11:00 : I don't know Remark - it could be NAB shareholders get MLC shares or they get a cash payout in way of a special dividend ot maybe NAAAAAB will just hold on to the proceeds with the SP rising as shareholder compensation.At this point (and no sale has even been entered into) they are keeping their cards close to their chest.I would love to know when it is going to happen though.

Do you know if NAB holders will receive shares in MLC once it is sold off? I remember reading a post about this.
