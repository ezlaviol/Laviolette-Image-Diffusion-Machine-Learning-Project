If you can justify a trading business then purchases and sale of shares plus any associated costs are treated as income / expenditure like any business. Any losses or profits will then be accounted for with other income.
If you are just investing then you can only account for capital gains / losses as stated. 
As suggested always a good idea to keep trading totally separate to other capital invested shares as it needs to be clear what, why & how you are trading (can't be just done a whim). 
Would be wise to talk to your Acct before establishing a trading business or if this is a bit unclear...................
