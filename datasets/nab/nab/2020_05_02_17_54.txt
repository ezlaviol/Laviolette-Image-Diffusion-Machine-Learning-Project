2020-05-02T17:54:00+10:00 : I do not know your age, I am in my fifties, and I promise you, life wasn't a walk in the park  for us either, when I was in my thirties. On our first home loan of  200K, we had to pay 36K interest/year. Now you can borrow 1m, and paying similar interest, but wages are much higher than in those years.
So we had to work overtime whenever it was possible we grabbed it with both hands. I myself had two jobs, one fulltime, and the other one was 20 hours/ week.
So don't tell me we are/were the spoilt generation, - we certainly wasn't scared working hard, and didn't waste our money on unnecessary luxuries.

So which one of us belong to the spoilt generation?

Pull yourself together, work harder, spend less, -oh, but that's too hard, isn't it?
