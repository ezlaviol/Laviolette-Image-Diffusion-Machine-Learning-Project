2018-10-27T08:22:00+11:00 : In the last 15 years or so, most banks sp have little or no growth including NAB.  The only consolation is their yield have been tracking above 5% excluding franking during that period.  So if you are an “active” investor/trader ie: buy/sell regularly, perhaps banks shares may not be a good choice.

You could though accumulate/buy at their dips (hence more units/shares per $1 spend) eg: now and hope they will still maintain their yield/dividend.....
