When people turn their minds back to NAB, Australian banks, stocks and the economy, I am neither reading nor hearing any of that pessimism, pessimism has pervaded the Australian banks of late bit like leftover meatloaf from the spring.A W shaped recovery would imply there is another second wave. That could happen as a result of the insurrection protests but even if it did, due to the Antifa and anti-social element, doubt it would be widespread.Citigroup is jumping up 6% in a day, even Wells Fargo, BAML, MS, GS and JP are all going well, and the trading would be more choppy if a W shape was conceivable IMHO. It is a fear fear itself argument, a W IMHO.cannot see any reason for a W shaped recovery in America, England, Canada and especially not in Australia and New Zealand. Australia and NZ might be assisted by a Global W given they would be unlikely to have a second phase of the pandemic based on the stats but I can’t see how America, Canada and England get a second wave given the high summer coming.Beijing and Asia are in a bit of a mess economically and socially because of the pandemic but that is unlikely to adversely affect the Australian banks. IN fact if Hong Kong becomes Beijing’s sacrificial lamb of subterfuge due to the it’s appalling uneconomic and Wuhan handling of the crisis, international banks might move from Hong Kong to Sydney (Singapore being land and infrastructure poor, infiltrated by MSS and quite difficult place to be a regional base for a large company). property rights are Stone Age, the apartments are expensive and graft is commonplace in society there.I think NAB will do alright and IMHO will reclaim its bullish resistance levels in the $30s along with the other banks.Change my sentiment to buy from hold.
