2020-05-19T15:50:00+10:00 : thank you Zabbro, i only use self wealth these days as the brokerage is a flat rate of $9.50 regardless of size of trade. to me that is unbeatable value for my needs trading on a short term basis only @ over $45,000 per trade. I have traded with nabtrade and cmc markets in the past but these platforms would be charging me over 300% more for the same trade without any extra benefit that I need. I haven't decided if I will always be 75% long yet. it will depends what is happening in the market surrounding my nab shares but I can't just sit and watch it go up and down 100% of the time without doing some form of trading as everything always goes up or down in a zig zag pattern.
