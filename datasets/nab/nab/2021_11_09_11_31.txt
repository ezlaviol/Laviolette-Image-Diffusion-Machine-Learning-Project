2021-11-09T11:31:00+11:00 : 67c to be honest is disappointing. Whomever writes the rubbish spin at nab just doesn’t get it. We’re not stupid. Saying the div has doubled is absolutely ridiculous to say given we are looking at emerging into a post covid, or covid tolerant, world they need to get back to reality. Many sins were cloaked behind the covid provision raising, not just by nab, but I don’t believe Chronican or McEwan are up to the job. That divvy should have been at least 72c and returning to $1.98 pa for the FY end 30SEP2022. NAB is being very very poorly led which is disappointing on so many levels.
