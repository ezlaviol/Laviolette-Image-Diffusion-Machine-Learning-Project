So the big drop on Friday appears to be part of a flight from risk and maybe the current state of global markets (and probably most significantly the US election) has motivated some money to exit the market should the opportunity present. 

This theory will be tested as the next decent yielding companies go ex divvy, let's see what happens generally or at least across the banks.

Having said that - I always feel for punters that get sucked into buying NAB (or any stock really) when they have had a good run and are trading towards 12 month highs. I never felt that NAB was a good buy at around $28 even though the yield still looked OK. 

Best to sit back and wait for those 12 month lows to come around before buying stocks like NAB. Sub $25 will be worth considering if she gets there IMHO.
