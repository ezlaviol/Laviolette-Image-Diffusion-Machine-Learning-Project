See http://www.firstadvisers.com.au/asic-ups-limit-for-share-purchase-plans-in-a-win-win-for-investors-and-corporates/A rights issue where the number of shares you can apply for is governed by what you already own would be a fairer approach, but I imagine SPP's like this will be very popular with retailer investor for the exact reason you describe - ie you can add quite significantly to a small holding at a discounted rate.Best we get comfortable with it, I'm sure we'll see many more before the financial year is up!
