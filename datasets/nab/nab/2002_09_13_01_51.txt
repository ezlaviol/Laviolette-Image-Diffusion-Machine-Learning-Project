2002-09-13T01:51:00+10:00 : I couldn't agree more with both of you. Its a house of cards and I make the pattern a rising wedge (as with ANZ also).I read the NAB buy back notice each morningand find that it has only been buying around250,000 shares a day due to the high price.Arthur, 250,000 shares out of 2-3 million surely can'tbe supporting the stock to the degree that itseems to be finding support in the market at the moment.I am perplexed to say the least.
