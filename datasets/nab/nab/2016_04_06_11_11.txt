My thoughts on it is by adding to a core holding atm is I am reducing my average price, also I don't gear so I get to choose when to sell. At some stage in the future I will sell to maintain a similar core holding. Yes they could go cheaper but I don't know that for certain and at present they are certainly cheap when you look at their earnings ability.
