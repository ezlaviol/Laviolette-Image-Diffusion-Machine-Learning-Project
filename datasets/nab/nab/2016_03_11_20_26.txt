2016-03-11T20:26:00+11:00 : Fair enough DeskW, i couln't agree more that the regulation combined with the market dominance that Aus banks enjoy gives a nice buffer but as an equity they are subject to the same market forces as everything else.. the business may not intrinsically change a lot but the market valuation can in a big way
I guess all i try to do is find the least risky undervalued stocks and NAB is one of them right now..
Next catalyst is earnings i guess, market sentiment seems to back in banks favour otherwise
