2019-02-03T16:10:00+11:00 : small parcel @ $22.00, bigger parcel @ $21.50, large parcel @ $21.00. I can amend on Monday / Tuesday if required and will closely watch the SP. I'm a rookie, not an analyst. I just take human behaviour into account and follow my gut instinct. If I miss out - so be it. For me it's just a gamble. Not really important. I'm playing the same game with ANZ. Hope this answers your question. Cheers Mate.
