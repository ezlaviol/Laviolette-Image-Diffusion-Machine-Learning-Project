2020-05-04T15:52:00+10:00 : 30 cent dividend for a 7% dilution of $15 ($1+ value) plus a higher drop than its peers on the down days. Plus I can see the sp drop further closer to close as people sell off to pay for the spp and the instos take profit. Can't see anyone getting their full allocation, as it will be oversubscribed.They're just some spitball calculations, but I'm not sure I see the good deal.
