2018-11-03T12:18:00+11:00 : It may be the fall is over. I was expecting the market to fall about now due to the situation in the US but it fell about 25 and 26 October about 6 or 7 trading days before I predicted. The reasons are the same. With a bit of luck the share price will fall on 8 October when it goes ex by less than the dividend. This happens sometimes with NAB. If so it is safe to say the worst is over for us and if so we may see a return to 27 and higher by March April
