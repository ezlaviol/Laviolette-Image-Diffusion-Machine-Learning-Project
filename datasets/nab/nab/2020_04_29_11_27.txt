2020-04-29T11:27:00+10:00 : Laoich .... sorry ???You start with "that is the biggest load of crap comment I have seen on this forum."  ...  and then go on to make comments  that have nothing to do with Grajem12's post.It seems to me that Grajem12 made very sensible , short, post.    The price currently of NAB is way over the 14.15 that NAB investors will be able to pay in week up to May22.    That tells me (IMO) investors are thinking they (who have the cash)  wont be able to get a full $30,000 allocation of NAB .... and that the SP post-May 22 will be way over 14.15.I wont say what I think of your Post, Laoich .... I'm too polite
