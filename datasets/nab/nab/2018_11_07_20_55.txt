Just look at the last ex - dividend.That is why I was considering a sell out, but as I said, for now the bad news is all factored in and we might get a strong return after this recording date.Cevatt, I agree that the outside influences will have a bigger bearing than anything domestic immediate short term.But I am extremely top heavy in finance shares and have been working on a strategy to get back into cash or bonds. I need to let NAB go sooner rather than later as some of my other finance shares offer a similar dividend return and have capital gain to go with it. I want a bit of time on the sideline and see the next few reporting quarters on housing and infrastructure.My best estimate is that infrastructure will stay strong and housing will soften a little until there is more clarity on the federal election. Having said that, all reports from the building product sector I have seen are still offering a strong showing.
