In the eighties it was land they don't make any more and people paid unrealistic prices.
I think we have a bubble in parts Australia it will either burst or deflate slowly but I also think many overseas buyers are already down the tube with the lower dollar but when prices come off a bit more many Asian buyers with their corrupt money will be gone like a fart in the breeze.
