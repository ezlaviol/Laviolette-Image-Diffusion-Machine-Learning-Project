2020-04-28T00:36:00+10:00 : I have no problem with immigrants , we are just not getting any for a while whilst country borders are closed and till COVID-19 Vaccine is found and becomes widely available. That could be up to two years plus whilst unemployment is high and gov borrowing is high do we need a few hundred thousand more people to become permanent residents. The 1.8m temporary residents by years end are not going to be citizens and can go home when they want and most likely will once they can't pay their bills. Do we need to pay a majority of these people without jobs benefits so they can pay their rents or send them home. Housing booms during permanent immigration and high temporary foreign residents coming here. Now we have a reversal in both so housing should crash and whilst household debt levels are at record highs it should crash spectacularly. Nab have not allocated any money to bad loans for retail real estate going bad.
