2016-06-14T14:42:00+10:00 : Just to offer a contrarian (and cautionary) view - jumping into any bank with both feet (and especially NAB) right now doesn't seem wise to me (just my 2c worth) based on a couple of things:

1. The ASX and the DJIA have had a fairly good run, from April - June the All Ords was up around 10% give or take... So the big stocks should generally be strong, right?

2. Despite this solid run, banking stocks find themselves at a fairly low ebb after just two bad trading days - today and Friday last week.

3. NAB was $27-$30 in January... The All Ords is about 300 points higher right now than it was in January - so the index is up, but banks down substantially.

What might happen if (say) we get another two bad days? Or ten bad days?

I'm sure everyone is making their own decisions & is comfortable with their own choices, I'm just completely unsure of where this market is going and the volatility we have seen globally this year tells me these banks could be up 20% in two weeks but equally probably is that they will be down 20% in two weeks.
