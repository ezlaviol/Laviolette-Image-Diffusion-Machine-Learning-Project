But with due deference to pensioners, I can't see how their costs have risen.I heard on the ABC radio overnight program a couple of nights ago complaining that the percentage rise of the pensioner wasn't as much as the percentage rise of the unemployed even though they were now getting the same amount. They thought their pension should have been doubled.It is a bit off topic, but what is the impact of government debt if stimulus occurs and nobody spends it?
