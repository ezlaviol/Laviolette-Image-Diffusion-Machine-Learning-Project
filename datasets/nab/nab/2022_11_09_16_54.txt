No complaints re active long only hedge funds whose high volume trades result in sp surges.  As well if the shorts get it wrong on occasions, short covering can result in significant upward sp's.  Doubtful if the shorts will be out of business, global assets are overpriced, and if we have any financial defaults or similar of any size, the global economies will be at risk.  Many fail to understand the only reason the shorters prevail on occasions is that there is not enough on the contra buy side.
