Then why would they require the CRs in the first place. The regulatory authorities you talk about. Do this so they can try to prevent or at least postpone the big and powerful from failing. That is it. You don't see these fools helping out the small mum and pop busines that is in need of help. No. They have to rise and fall on their own merit. And pay for mistakes they have made. To rescue a large troubled institution in a crisis. Also has many moral hazards. This encourages institutions to take on more risk than it normally would. If they know that they will receive benefits from the risks and mismanagement they have already undertaken. They will continue to take even more risks in the future. This is just simple human psychology. If you continue to reward those that have done wrong. They will continue to do wrong. And never learn. This will continue until they end up crashing and buring in the end. Do you really think that NAB would be around today without the CR. I highly doubt it. So tell me how they are any better today than in the past. To me they are in much worse shape. And i am suprised that they are still around and not in the memory vault.
