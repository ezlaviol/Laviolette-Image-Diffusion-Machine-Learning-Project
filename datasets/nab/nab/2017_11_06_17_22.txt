2017-11-06T17:22:00+11:00 : I think ex divvy we could see around 28.50, just my personal opinion I could be wrong, but I just cant see any major catalyst at the moment for any uptick, I think once the div is paid investors will look to rotate their money out and into other stocks with more potential for capital growth and also div.

im not a holder, but have sold put options on this in the past, if it gets down to 28-29 I will look at selling some insurance on it.

good luck all
