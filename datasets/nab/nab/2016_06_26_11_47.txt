2016-06-26T11:47:00+10:00 : As Hunter S Thompson might say, Friday was a wild blast that not even the hard boys can handle.

I said there was more to lose from Leave than could be gained by Remain  and that I wouldn't buy back in unless it was a Leave and prices dropped by 5%.

Well I was wrong about two things. First I think the o/s markets were continuing to rise Friday morning and the ASX was going to have a ripper. So I was regretting missing that.

My second failed prediction was that I got in well before it dropped 5%: a couple of times actually.  Not to buy on Friday would have gone against all my values 

So I'm happy to see some optimism about.

It was amazing to see a 30% drop in Lloyds but it was encouraging to see a HSBC share price which was green at some time. Don't know why, but hoping it has a lot to do with them being more involved  in Asia (I know they did have some troubles last week over a billion dollar settlement while the other banks enjoyed a Remain surge).

The drop in the US banks of 7+ percent worries me of course.

On the big picture, Brexit is disappointing to me because I am a supporter of globalisation and free trade. It needs to be fair trade and the benefits need to go to working people as well as the owners of capital.

Fundamentally though,  free trade has lifted and continues to lift the living standards of billions of people, including Australians.

Brexit is the most significant reversal for global free trade in decades.

 What readers to a banking thread on HC might get from this philosophising: the consequences could be negative growth, destruction of shareholder value - especially for the banks - falling wages and rising costs.
