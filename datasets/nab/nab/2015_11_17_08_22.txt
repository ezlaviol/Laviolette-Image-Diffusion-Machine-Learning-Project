2015-11-17T08:22:00+11:00 : I see poor old NAB chief Andy Thorburn has only been paid 5.5 mil for his first full year at NAB.   We shall have to take up a collection for the poor fellow.  His self esteem must diminished when he reads that his counterparts at CBA, ANZ and WBC are being paid 8 M, 10.8 M and 12 M respectively.  When one considers what a great job Andy and his predecessors have done, perhaps the shareholders could pass the hat around...

As to that left wing collection of ratbags called the Financial Services Union, I am pleased that their continued call for "better job security, a better pay deal for everyone that reflects the effort we have all put in and acknowledges the cost of living pressures we are all facing, and a better work life balance" has been treated with the contempt it deserves.  A NAB spokesman answered their continued call for better conditions by saying that the bank awards their employees with "a competitive pay rate within the financial services market."  

Good on ya, NAB.
