My reason for liking NAB right now is that they have recently spent a great deal of effort on automation & process improvement which should reduce fixed costs and improve performance, making them significantly more competitive and more profitable medium term.  Plus they have the largest payout ratio of the four.  It should play out pretty well over the coming years in my estimation.

I would call that value investing - something Warren might like.
