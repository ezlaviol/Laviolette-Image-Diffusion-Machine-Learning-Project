2022-07-22T08:35:00+10:00 : I remember when i was a young man (mid 20's) someone made the local paper when they bought a heap of stock in NAB at around $25 ... that was a long time agoand here we are 25 years later (25 seems to be a magic number with NAB) and I bought a heap at $25.65 the other week.NAB is what I call a yoyo stock.. up, retrace, up, retrace and basically goes nowhere..unlike say CBA (which by the way many brokers knock and have always knocked!)There is a train of thought with NAB amongst the "pros"That is, hold long and let the divs (which aren't what they used to be) make up the shortfall in lackluster capital growthme...i still remember the dood buying big 25 years ago..so for me, once NAB hits above $30.. I'll pull the trigger, as I always do with this stock, leave profits as shares in, and take out my original investment (no tax to pay)..then do it all again when the time is right..Not investment AdviceAll IMODYORchow all:-]
