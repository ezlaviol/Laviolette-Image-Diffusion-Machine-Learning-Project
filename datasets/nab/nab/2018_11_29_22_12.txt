2018-11-29T22:12:00+11:00 : NAB has had higher costs (due to restructure) and are yet to see the benefits of that restructure. When that starts to flow through to earnings I think the share price will improve. Would also be nice to see a major initiative by NAB that actually works for a change. Also my reading of the banking royal commission is that CBA and NAB have come off poorly compared to WBC and ANZ but that might just be my take, they have all proven to be substandard.Â  On the positive side NAB is the least exposed to the housing market so that might mean the others face further impairments going forward - not that NAB will rise but other banks may fall a bit.DYOR
