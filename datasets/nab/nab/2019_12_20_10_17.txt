2019-12-20T10:17:00+11:00 : Bit hard to speak in isolation for any bank in the current environment. All the banks are getting tarred with the one brush and if they haven't been pursued for something in particular, comments or rumours that they will abound 
For NAB, expansion woes is nothing new and many administrations have found out the hard way it is not so easy to just operate elsewhere. The great Homeside debacle is now a distant memory 
Except for the behaviour of our leaders at the RC, NAB wasn't too bad off with it's core banking relatively unscathed, however the Insurance and Financial planning arms were badly mauled. (I was totally unsurprised at the FP debackle and have never liked that model)
Unfortunately when we see the recent headlines about ASIC charges some appear to forget that these actually relate to issues already discovered at the RC and not new "scandals"
I am not saying nothing more will come out for NAB and I sincerely hope that they are not caught up in the Austrac issues, which are being carefully looked at now.
You are absolutely right that NAB needs to start treating customers and shareholders with respect and is similar to my comment earlier about taking responsibility and not blaming others (response to that other nonsense).
Unfortunately that will take some time and in the interim we will be dragged through the mud for the same thing many times and anything new will create uproar. 
Note - NAB is not perfect and will always have some sort of issues however the correct overview and governance should find any misdeed and fix asap.
(I guess a fair bit of the above could be written on any Bank's thread)
