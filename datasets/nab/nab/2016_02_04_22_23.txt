2016-02-04T22:23:00+11:00 : esp. now it looks like US holding fire on rates... so it's back to the big aussie banks for global investors chasing yield! ignore the doom and gloom unless you have been holding since $40..lots of noise about dividends coming under pressure and fair enough but even if yield was 5% with 100% franking credits, it still beats most any other 'safe' yielding asset..
big financials looking oversold IMHO.. bought NAB and SUN for 7-10% yield fully franked plus what i expect to be modest capital gain ..
