2020-08-25T10:00:00+10:00 : The banks will be back.There is nothing surer.If you go back 1000 years, the banks were banks.If you go forward 1000 years, the banks are still going to be banks.The history of banks go back to 2000 BC.  I doubt they are going anywhere any time soon.BNPL is their only competition in the current market, and there is more chance of them going under than any of the big 4.
