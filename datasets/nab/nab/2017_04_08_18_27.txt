When the value of investment properties lies in their tax benefits as opposed to their ability to create value through rental income... well thats a clear market distortion. The political pressure on the cost of housing as well as pressure on the national budget resulting from these NG and CGT arrangements is just one way this could begin to unravel. I was living in the UK and Ireland when their property markets crashed and nobody expects it until it happens, everyone just accepts the notion that property valuations will always rise as fact, which is dangerous and simply not true.
So I invest as though it could happen anytime in the next year or so and try to ensure I am not over-exposed by preferencing stocks that I believe will perform relatively better in the event. Better to be prepared.
