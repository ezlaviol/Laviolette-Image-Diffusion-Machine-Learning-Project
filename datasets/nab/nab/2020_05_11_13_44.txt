2020-05-11T13:44:00+10:00 : I contend an investor had rocks in his/her head for investing in NAB in the first place or more likely they were clearly misled and misinformed by NAB management or as many holders are, lured by its dividend yield which turns out to be a trap. I alluded to this in my post above where I provided a summary of my detailed analysis.You made a bunch of statements hyping NAB up which are incorrect. Its SP was well below $30 before COVID-19 and far below its record high of ~$40 that it hit in the 2000s. So I'm not sure statements like "it would probably be above 30 bucks" actually mean anything? It's like saying CBA would "probably be above $100" if this crisis didn't happen either, and other companies like FLT and WEB probably wouldn't have to raise capital. They're all moot points - what it isn't, in this case, is the history of how management guide these institutions through crises and track record over time of treating shareholders, as well as factors that can point to their future prospects.I have made detailed points above that NAB has proven to have the weakest performance in both up and down markets and that it has constantly been mismanaged throughout its history; its share price has languished long-term, its dividends have been the most volatile and it is the weakest of the Big Four as far as its capital buffers go. It doesn't even have a clear turnaround strategy whereas MQG and CBA are positioned for growth and digital.Where in all of this is the case that NAB is the "clear winner" when the other banks are so much better capitalised and in a better position to pay/resume paying dividends? Can you give us a clear thesis?
