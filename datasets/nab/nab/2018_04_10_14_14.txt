2018-04-10T14:14:00+10:00 : I like NAB for the twice yearly .99c per share dividend. All of the banks looking stronger today.

Really depends if you're investing or trading...

NAB's 52 week swing is 34.09 to 28.01 - trading now at 29.15

ANZ 's 52 week swing is 32.95 to 26.21  - now 27.20

CBA's 52 week swing is 87.74 to 71.45  - now 74.45

WBC's 52 week swing is 35.30 to 28.32  - now 29.51

All IMO, not investment advice, DYOR, I'm not guilty your honor....
