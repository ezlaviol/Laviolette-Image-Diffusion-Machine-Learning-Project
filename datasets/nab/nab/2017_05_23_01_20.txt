2017-05-23T01:20:00+10:00 : Thank you for your email regarding the above. I note that today all the major banks appear to have released a statement.

Regardless of being a shareholder, let me say this â€“ I failed to note any of you rail against the support you received during the GFC, both from the Federal Government and shareholders.

You are deemed to be a pillar of society, but that is not a one-way street. I suggest you trim your margins and executive salaries in order to meet this new impost.

You cry poor too often.

Should shareholders be expected to carry an unfair burden I will be advocating voting against the Remuneration Report, and Director Re-election and for a spill.

Thank-you for requesting my feedback.

Kind regards
