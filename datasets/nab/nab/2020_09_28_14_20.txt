In common person's language, for a good economy, money must change hands i.e. the engine should keep running.. the stimulus will improve buying power by increasing the disposable income (but only marginally in these conditions.. which is why is called a stimulus.. so it keeps the engine at least in idle throttle, just running but no acceleration). The effect of this along with responsible lending restrictions will help ensure that the SP doesn't tank. SP growth back to 20% upside can only happen after reasonable recovery and eradication of Covid (which will help the engine come out of idling and throttle a bit).This doesnt take into account short trend manipulations in the market (thats a different story altogether because people can make in a downtrend as well).
