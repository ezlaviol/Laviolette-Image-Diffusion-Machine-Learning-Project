2020-03-06T17:22:00+11:00 : complete carnage in a slaughterhouse market. Everything and every sense is being massacred in a senseless display of carnage, violence on the bourse and mindless unequivocal bloodletting.The polyannas have left. Mike Baird just walks. more wanton destruction appears to perhaps follow. Even AUSTRAC under Nicole Rose remains unashamed from the press of the weekend.Ross McEwen and Simon McKeon, the undertakers of RBS and AMP respectively, have come in IMHO to be undertakers and coroners to attest the time of deadliness.It is a market of pure filth and fantasy worthy of one of those uncensored senseless Canadian heavy trashy humanless websites on the dark web that Prime Minister Trudeau allows, permits and sacrilegiously exonerates in the Canadian dark wide web.
