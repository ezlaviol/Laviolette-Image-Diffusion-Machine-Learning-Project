2020-01-20T12:16:00+11:00 : So Simon McKeon of AMP, RIO and Spotless fame is at NAB, all of AMP, RIO and Spotless have not gone so well. AMP is in a hopeless state after governance, risk and compliance failings in the the Financial Services Royal Commission, RIO loses Takeover Panel decisions over Energy Resources of Australia and its governance, risk and compliance has been called into question. Spotless was going so badly it was bought by Downer Group for as cheap as chips due to contract issues, and now Downer Group is at all time highs, Spotless having been integrated so well.AO appears to have lost its shine with a few unsavory people having the title and not having it extinguished in spite of failings across all walks of life including Royal Commissions into Children, Financial Services and others. A much tarnished title.What does NAB do? Appoints Simon McKeon to the board. Perhaps the SP needs to be a little lower for the incoming Directors, Executives such as McEwen and his incomign team to make their bonus or something, because the McKeon appointment appears odd?Who next? Lindsay Maxsted, Catherine Brenner, Ian Narev?Change my sentiment from buy to hold.
