You know why did bank went for capital raise at $14?  because they knew that they don't need the cash but biggest beneficiary to this capital raise with be funds & insto who normally have bigger say in approving board members and remuneration report. that is why they did CR at $14 and then straight away within less then 12 months they said that they have excess funds so we are doing on market buy-back instead of buying Bendigo or BOQ or ABA or any other business on their radar to create shareholders value they simply wanted to do buy - back so the funds who paid them $14 get back $28 within a 1 year which is 100% profit on investment without any risk what so ever... in my opinion. the CEO & Chairman and board absolutely deserve sacking in my opinion.
