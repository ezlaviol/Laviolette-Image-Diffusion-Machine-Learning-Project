2019-01-22T14:27:00+11:00 : Try these reasons for starters:-1. Dow futures down 160 points at the moment2. IMF forcasting slow down in global growth from 3.7% to 3.5%. - still optimistic in my book3. Shadow treasurer saying Oz investors better off investing overseas than chasing FF Oz shares for their div. (What an imbecile)4. Shares rallied hard since Dec low. Time for a breather5. RC findings early Feb. (most likely factored in inmo)6. Brexit mess7. Trade wars - Star Wars - Global warming - you name it !8. Still got my BOQ shares as acquired at $9.50. Great yield9. Traded my NAB shares close to $25 for a profit but waiting to buy back in for their great returnThe doozie of them all is Labors franking credit policy attacking us senior citizens. That is not helping bank shares either. The Libs could not get $1B of tax cuts thru the Senate so am hoping the favor is returned to the next mob.Go Ash Barty. Now there is a winner................even if she loses.
