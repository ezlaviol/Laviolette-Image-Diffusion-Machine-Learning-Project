I am saying probably not a miracle cure.You are saying possibly a good treatment option.If it is we should know in a month.  There is a BBC story with the numbers.237 patients 158 using the drug 79 who didn't.13.9% fatalities in those taking and 12.8% in those who didn't.Obviously it is not conclusive.  And denied by the company.But the original leak could have been to boost the stock.
