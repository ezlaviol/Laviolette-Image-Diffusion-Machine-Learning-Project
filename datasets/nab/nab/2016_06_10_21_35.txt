2016-06-10T21:35:00+10:00 : I took a bullish position in CBA today and judging by the buying glee by yourself Nanood and others plus the fact the VIX shows people using the drop to take a punt on a rise... it all makes me a bit worried that there is a clear contrarian bearish position to be taken. And I haven't taken it.
