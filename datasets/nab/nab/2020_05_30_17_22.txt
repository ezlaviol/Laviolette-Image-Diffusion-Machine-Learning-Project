2020-05-30T17:22:00+10:00 : Thanks Eric. That is great feedback...I believe my stocks are classified as Assets. I rarely trade. I have a full time job. Most NAB I am holding is from last two years...As per my understanding, minimum time to hold a stock is 60 days to be classified at Asset Class. If one hold less than 60 days, sells them, it is treated as Trading Stock, else as Asset class ? (I could be totally wrong here)..However, I need to talk to my accountant, if is she who decide what category to put them."When an investor receives a stock dividend, the holding period for the new shares, or portions of a new share, is the same as for the old shares. Meeting the minimum holding period is the primary requirement for dividends to be designated as qualified. For common stock, the holding must exceed 60 days throughout the 120-day period, which begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date. "
