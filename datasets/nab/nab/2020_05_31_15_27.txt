2020-05-31T15:27:00+10:00 : Thanks Gindaldan,Carrying Forward of Unsold Units is a total Nightmare (One need to keep which year they were bought and how many and which batch of units sold which year and what was taxable income in that year)...I plan to sell everything and buy again. Simple. Saves me 1000s on accounting charges... Either way loss is on paper only but Profit is always Taxed.
