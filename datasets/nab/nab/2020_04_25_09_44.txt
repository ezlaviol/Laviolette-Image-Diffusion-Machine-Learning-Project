I also bought similar amounts of WBC, TLS and STW at the same time.  Sold the WBC at the same time and the other two the day after from memory.  I should have kept all.Except I am more in the bearish camp and have been surprised at how well Australia has been doing.My play is that the US in my strong opinion is mishandling their situation. When they collapse then ours will go down.  At that time I will go all in for the long term.
