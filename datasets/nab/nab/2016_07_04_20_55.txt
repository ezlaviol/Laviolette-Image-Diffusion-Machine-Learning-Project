2016-07-04T20:55:00+10:00 : Yes my (Li)ttle friend has been kind. Yours was also up 5% if you are still with it. There are many that say mine still has a long, long way to run  (some of the guys on that thread really know their stuff ).

NAB payday tomorrow . It had a bit of a run towards close, so you are already green on your position from today . Futures are up here and in the US (no trading for them today) and FTSE is flat. I think green tomorrow. 

I get the feeling things are about to start going up for the banks, I don't know why. I did say earlier that a trifecta would be Brexit, ALP and Trump. Well Brexit yes, ALP almost though it looks like no one won convincingly, desperately hoping Trump no , but that is a few months away. Despite Brexit and our election the banks have held on, so I think things will start improving from here over the next few months. Hopefully some good results from CBA will help. It also looks like we are heading for another RBA cut soon, though probably not tomorrow, though you never know, they seem more proactive this year then previously. That should help the SP. It has to get over $27.25  soon..... please, pretty please. 

Other asx20 stocks are rising (road builder for example; I have to mention it every now and then as it has also been kind to me and that thread is DEAD, like a deserted road ), banks turn now thank you.

And as a worst case scenario, if they don't and BOQ does not rise, I'll be going shopping for cake, a very, very big one, and a shovel ..... Hope you are hungry .
