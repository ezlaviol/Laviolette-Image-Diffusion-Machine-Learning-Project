2018-05-04T18:38:00+10:00 : Mark,... highly appreciated ur help here,... the date range is fine,...

Two takeaways here from Mark's %loss/gain charts :-

1) AMP has been doing above 0%, which signifies no drop in price,... till about the first week of March when those reports came out, and it plunged. Today, it is at -20.62% down against the start of this year (look at the YTD Chart =at the top).

On the 6-Month Chart, it is at -7.42% down, far below the 'second' one. Both of the -20.62% and the -7.42% downs are the worst among the companies shown.

2) BOQ has been doing very well over the Big Four + AMP till round about te third week of February this year, when it plunged way down. It is just at -17.82 (YTD Chart), only above AMP. If AMP did not have the about have those bad news,... I think BOQ would have 'won' the bottom spot here....

This,... I'm surprised.
