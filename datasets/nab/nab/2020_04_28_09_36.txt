2020-04-28T09:36:00+10:00 : I'd have to concur ...had a look at the offer documents yesterday and after much reflection and discussion (really the only upside for us would be to increase our existing holdings to average down costs ) decided no already got enough exposure to banks, NAB included.  Banks for us are as always a long term hold, for my folks who are self funded retirees they are a dividend producing income stream, and yes I do think in time they will regain significant ground however this will take quite some time ....so not a short term proposition and at this time we think they have already had enough of our funds injected ...in essence not a time for us to put more in when we already have a significant NAB holding IMHO.
