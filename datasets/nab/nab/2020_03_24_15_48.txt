Trying very hard to hold $14.The dividend has to take a dip. I was banking (no pun intended) on 75 cents but maybe now it drop to say 70 cents. I may be being too hard with that prediction. Still decent.

Disappointing NAB looks to be giving back her gains today. Investor confidence in this share is on par with me before my yr 12 formal. Will be interesting to see what happens with the dividend. Hoping it stays at 83c and certainly that it doesn't get cut completely.
