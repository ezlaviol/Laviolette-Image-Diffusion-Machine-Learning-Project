2019-11-25T21:58:00+11:00 : NAB will separate MLC. The process has begun. Very soon one will not be able to see the MLC stuff on the NAB login for example (I forget the date given for the change to occur). They will probably sell it to private equity. Not sure what they plan to do with the cash, but regardless NAB will be better capitalised than they are now. NAB was over $28 recently, until WBC threw some sh*t in the spinning fan and then everything got sprayed and is now a bit smelly, and hence on sale.
