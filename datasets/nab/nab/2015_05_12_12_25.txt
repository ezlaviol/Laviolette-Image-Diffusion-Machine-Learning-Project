Doubt this will ever be cheaper than it is today, all banks are/will be doing a cap raising to meet higher regulatory reserves just NABs first cab off the rank.  The fact is with no fall in SP today after coming off a TH and with a cap raising so cheap for the lucky ones who can get new shares, you make a quick $7-$8 a share for doing SFA.  Nothing like a penny dreadful CR where the SP immediately drops to the CR price on ann!
