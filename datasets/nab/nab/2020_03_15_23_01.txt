2020-03-15T23:01:00+11:00 : Flip a coin!I kind of think the market will be a bit undecided. It might start off fairly flat as it looks for direction. I suppose it’s a matter of waiting to see how the funds take in weekend news.If buying continues from Friday and we respond well to the two big positives;- China ramps up manufacturing.- Dow up 10%Expect opening to be kind $19+If market focuses heavily on the overseas travel quarantining.Expect a sell off $15-16Whatever the case, I expect a mid day rally, I believe China will have a big green open. I think tomorrow is more of a question of what will we close at.Good early trade close low $19Bad early trade close mid $17That said I’ve heard people doomsaying as much as 20% at open. I couldn’t imagine that to be realistic at all. It does feel as though funds and governments are taking up some buying opportunities
