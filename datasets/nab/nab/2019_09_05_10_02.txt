Its ok if no one wants to debate the market...usually its because they hiding something but if i were a NAB shareholder i would not be too worried since I know most NAB staff can look after themselves very well and ive met some ex NAB people who should be in jail for the misleading information they peddled in asx reports where people actually lost money and yet they ended up getting a senior advisory roles at ANZ Bank. But sure I agree ignore is a great tool in investment research and economic debate.  Good luck.
