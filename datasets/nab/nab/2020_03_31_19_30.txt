Employment will return to Sydney and Melbourne provided law and order is maintained IMHO. NAB is located in Melbourne which is not as good as the others but still should see a lot of return in employment. Sydney and Melbourne could be on the touch of a "Golden Decade" just has to get over the ignominy of the Wuhan virus.
