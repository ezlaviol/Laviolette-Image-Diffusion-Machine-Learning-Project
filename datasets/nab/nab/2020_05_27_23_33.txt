2020-05-27T23:33:00+10:00 : I think the pro-rata refers to the ratio of shares withheld to the total number of shares withheld by the SPP applicants.I worked out that the SPP applicants (25% of all NAB shareholders) hold ~604M shares (equivalent to 21% of all NAB's shares).NAB is issuing ~88M new shares.An applicant who holds 10,000 shares has a pro-rata of (10,000/604M X 88M) = 1462 new shares, worth 1462 x $14.15 = $20,700.So if this SH applied for $30k, they will be scaled back to receive $20,700 worth of shares.for shareholders with a small number of shares, let's say 300 shares, their pro-rata would be 43 new shares, those will receive the minimum of 176 shares worth ~$2500, regardless of the amount that they applied for whether $4k, $5k, 20k or $30kI hold 253 shares, applied for $10k, expecting to just receive the minimum of 176 new shares as my pro-rata is 37 shares, so the minimum rule will apply to me.
