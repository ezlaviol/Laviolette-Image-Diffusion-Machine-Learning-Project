IMO before the vote the "media sentiment" will turn towards an exit vote and the markets will take another beating. I took out of BEN with 1k profit and NAB the same. Still behind on ANZ and BOQ. When the market is volatile F01 take profits when they are offered to you. Volatile markets are great for trading and emotionally challenging for holding. I'll be right back into NAB as soon as this rubbish is over and the next reason for a market swing is the media hype.


I'm really hoping for a BEN retrace tomorrow. I love that stock and it was you that brought it to my attention. I'll be watching for a retrace tomorrow!
