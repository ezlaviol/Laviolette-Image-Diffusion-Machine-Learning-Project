2019-06-17T22:15:00+10:00 : NAB went down again 2day when all the other banks went up.It might be due to the AMP scandal being perhaps more applicable to NAB than the other three banks but their sponsorship of unacceptable and inappropriate commentary from the Australian women's captain, Sam Kerr, does not help.You are clearly equating their sponsorship with gender. Why? Why can NAB not sponsor on merit and integrity? All the Australian woman's football team seems good for is a sacking and a crass comment from Sam Kerr.Does the "suck on that one" comment and Sam Kerr's behavior really be appropriate behavior for NAB to attach its name to?
