Unless there is a cure, social distancing will not last long with sexually active people. The ramifications of this are huge. Social distancing is slowing the spread but only a cure will fix the share price of banks. Staples is where you want to be in this market. Everyone needs to eat but nobody needs to buy a house when they've already living in one.  looking at nabs long term chart since 1987 I see a nice little gap staring me in the face from 1993 and nabs down ward spiral is heading straight for it and looks like it will hit within the next 2 years.
