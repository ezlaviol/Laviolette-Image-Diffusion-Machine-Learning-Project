Thanks.
My guess is that Ms J Papageorgiou has direct experience of the Bail In laws that were enacted in Cyprus a few years back. Anyone with a balance greater than â‚¬200,000 lost the amount above that and were given bank shares in lieu of. But they were basically worthless.
The Aust govt has similar laws in place here which are a concern.
I would never have imagined they would have need for them, but then along came Covid, a trillion dollar debt and a fallout with our largest trading partner.
Hopefully it never happens here.
