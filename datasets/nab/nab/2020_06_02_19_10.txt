2020-06-02T19:10:00+10:00 : Not actually sure why anyone would be happy. I originally had over 2,000 shares until I left (retired) the organisation in July 2018. Got rid of all of them except 500 @ around $28.50. The last couple of years has seen share price go backwards and if you have been a long term holder you probably have had a significant capital loss. I did top up given the low price and ended up with the minimum allocation but generally most holders would have a negative position due to the capital loss. The dividend supported the price up until now but that has been slashed to what will be the new norm going forward.
