Also - expensive middle management from
$100-$250kpa (pending level, city and organisation size for pay differences) will see a lot of jobs losses as well. Already seeing centralisation of management across many large businesses to reduce the heavy pay scales. Will also consume the consulting industry. Who honestly wants to pay $500-$1,500 per hour for expensive consultants who often can barely even tie their own shoelace (im an ex consultant, can't believe the fees we would charge).
