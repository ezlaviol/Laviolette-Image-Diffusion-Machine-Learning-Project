Kristina might not know the history but when I worked in CBD in Melbourne the NAB were the first to employ strikingly attractive female tellers in their William Street branch when most banks only had men. The money market lads suggested it was to attract the business guys to their branch and so Kristina Keneally might be right about using women to attract new business is a bit backward. That was during 1970's if I recall correctly.
