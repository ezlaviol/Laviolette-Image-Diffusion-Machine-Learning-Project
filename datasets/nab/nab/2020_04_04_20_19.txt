People stopped entering the country prior to testing and other logical and duty of care like ignored infected  passengers from cruise ships by our government then we probably wouldn’t have this problem now. Instead we have trillions of dollars in relief funding provided to the nation at undisclosed product disclosure statement to the citizens with unknown interest and non democratic shut down based on questionable evidence.Interesting times where everyone loses assets without even being asked. All IMO, but other than death rates (lower than many other statistics that usually get ignored) seems like the biggest scam in history in my personal opinion. Has it really reached the stage people can’t eat a kebab alone in a park? If so this government  probably deserves whatever eventuates.
