2020-04-08T09:10:00+10:00 : This is basically good cop vs bad cop and the Board basically pointing the finger at APRA when cancelling the upcoming dividend and saying don't blame us, blame them (APRA).It's coming folks - don't expect any Divs from our Banks in the next reporting period as a minimum, possibly two.What do we think will happen to the SP when this gets confirmed, I think they'll cop a bit of a hiding?
