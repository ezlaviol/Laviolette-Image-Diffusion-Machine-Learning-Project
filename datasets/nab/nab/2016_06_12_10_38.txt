At 75 odd a share CBA is too capital intensive compared to the other banks. I am looking at slowly accumulating and holding these indefinitely. It is a good anchor to provide some stability to my holdings while still providing reasonable dividends. Bit like a faithful Labrador. Coming up to dividends I don't think it will get to 71, but if it does happy days. 
Have not warmed up to BOQ, don't know why. Time for another look I think. 
Ben will be my most watched on Tuesday.   Bring on the red.
Good luck .
