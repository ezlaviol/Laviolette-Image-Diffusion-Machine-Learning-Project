2019-11-08T06:21:00+11:00 : Fair enough commentary. Be interesting over the next week to see if NAB's bounce yesterday was over cooked of whether we will see the SP continue to edge up a bit more towards the ex-div date.I think you may be right about the SP settling after that.  Maybe $28 given the still unsettled environment.Note that the DOW is currently up 240 points on the back of China and the US agreeing to wind back tariffs - always a good thing for the ASX when there is a bit of good news from overseas. If this continues then it may shore up the SP for banks in general.Still think we could have another interest rate cut - though that is not certain and it would be the last one. That will work against bank profitability further. Though I do suspect we've seen the worst.Your view on MLC is of interest. Perhaps this could be the reason it has been delayed - or at least NAB was waiting to get the best chance of a good offer. Maybe the less than perfect result will accelerate the efforts to off-load MLC.

I think it will stay at these sorts of levels and trade range between say $26-$28.50 AUD. NAB much like CBA appear hamstrung with the MLC (or in the case of CBA, CFS piece) so ANZ and WBC are probably the better plays in the sector apart from the regionals such as BEN and BOQ who should arguably now be able to gain traction.NAB’s result was poor. Understand your bit about NAB being sold off due to the WBC result earlier in the week.All things considered NAB held up well yesterday.Change my sentiment from sell to hold but not rushing out to buy just yet.
