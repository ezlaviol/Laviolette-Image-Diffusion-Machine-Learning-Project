2019-02-21T09:28:00+11:00 : 785,288 Shares in Performance Rights to Andrew Gregory THORBURN. That is almost 20 Million Dollars in Today Term..Wait There is More. That is just the CEO. I am sure 100s of other executive probably hold 10 time more performance Shares... I often wonder how the hell of earth these guys reach to the top. Only way they do is "You scratch my back and I scratch your back" Technically Rewarding Each Other with Excessive Pay Package....
