2017-08-27T00:07:00+10:00 : I am waiting until ex divvy (just a few days away) on TLS to re-assess where I am going there. I believe that she may be whacked quite heavily after this divvy, but that should clear the decks for a new base to form and potentially build back towards $5 as they stop giving all the earnings away in divvies and start using some to grow the business.
