2020-06-03T17:21:00+10:00 : I had promised myself not to respond to anymore threads on the NAB SPP as the misinformation and lack of effort to understand terms and conditions is very frustrating.
But, can't help myself, so to try and assist here are the clauses in relation to a charity donation (only for amounts $10 and under) and also refund details:- (My underlines)
Note - the charity donation obviously makes more sense than additional processing for such small amounts and everyone should have known!)
12.3 Where an amount to be returned or refunded is A$10 or less, it will be automatically donated to ShareGift Australia. Where an amount to be refunded exceeds A$10, NAB will return this amount to you in accordance with term 12.5 below.
(Clause 12.4 details the receipt request etc so I haven't bothered to copy it)
12.5 NAB will refund Application monies using one of the following methods at its discretion:
(a) by returning your cheque or money order to you by post to your registered address;
(b) by direct credit to the bank account that you have previously nominated to NAB, for the purposes of receiving dividend payments;
(c) by cheque posted to your registered address;
(d) by BPAY in Australian dollars (if you paid via BPAY) or by direct credit in New Zealand dollars (if you paid by direct credit in New Zealand dollars); and
(e) any other method determined by NAB in its discretion.
Also , these are the relevant dates as per ASX ann in relation to completion of SPP dated 27/5/20:-
Trading of the SPP Shares is expected to commence on the ASX on 3 June 2020. Holding statements will be despatched to successful applicants from 4 June 2020. Refunds for scaled back applications (as well as withdrawal requests and late and invalid applications) are expected to be made from 4 June 2020.
Note there was 155,000 applicants and I daresay many will have different ways of communication and payment, hence words like from and expected (always be someone with some odd circumstances)
