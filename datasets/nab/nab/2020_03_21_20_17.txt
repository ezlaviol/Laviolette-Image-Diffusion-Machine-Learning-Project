2020-03-21T20:17:00+11:00 : We have about two weeks to prepare before the proverbial hits the fan.  We need to intensify our social distancing to slow this down. We need to source/manufacture drugs especially antivirals. We need to work out where we set up temporary hospitals. We need to start manufacturing ventilators/respirators. We need to retrain people who are now out of work as nurses and other medical staff. This is war. We need to prepare and mobilize now.
