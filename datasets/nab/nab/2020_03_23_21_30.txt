I am not sure who those mindless fools at Bondi Beach were last weekend that spurred the Commonwealth and State Governments to come up with these additional measures but I think we needed them.  When queues start forming outside hospitals for respirators and people are turned away (over 60 with heart/respiratory issues) there will be political fall out that will not bode well for stability.  Equity markets will react to that in a negative manner.
