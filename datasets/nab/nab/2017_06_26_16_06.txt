Here's some non-trivial bank charges on British banks:

Starting in April, banks will be able to apply only 50 percent of their profits against past losses to calculate their tax bill, rather than all of their profits. Over five years, the measure is expected to generate 3.5 billion pounds, or $5.5 billion, Treasury documents said.

Finance Minister George Osborne said last week that the government would replace a levy on bank balance sheets with a surcharge on profits, but the two schemes will run concurrently until 2020, placing an additional burden on lenders.  The new surcharge will tax banks 8 percent on their profits from next year and is the fifth new bank tax introduced in the past five years.

Of course, the corporate tax rate in the UK is 20%, so the tax grab over and above this must be seen in the light of Australia's 30% rate.  But even so, I think the reaction to a 0.06% "riskier" borrowings tax is a little over done? 

No-one likes taxes, but methinks banks squeal too much.
