2015-07-16T09:59:00+10:00 : Negative Gearing should be for ALL HOME OWNERS !!

Ps ; Negative Gearing ..should be applied to...ALL..home loan Borrowers ..including First Home Owners !!!

This will give a Level playing field ..to all Home Buyers ...regardless of weather its a family Home or an Investment !!

that would Help Solve the Affordability IMBALANCE of home ownership and Disadvantages to First Home Buyers struggling with Family Expenses and Mortgage pressure.

Mortgage costs assistance ..thru Negative Gearing for family home buyers ..is a Form of TAX RELIEF for Working Families ...with no Bracket Creep reform Needed .

Falling Interest Rates ..makes this Negative Gearing expansion ..more affordable for the Government.

A 100% Tax Deduction for Investors 
and
A 50% Tax Deduction for Home Loans for Resident Owners .. is FAIR !! and BALANCED !!

That Tax deduction and saving for Home Owners ..Helps new Owners into the market .. Frees up more Consumer Spending Capital to return to the Retail Industry as households get a form of debt relief thru Tax relief.

Retail will Benefit from increased spending power ..
Banks will see increased Borrowing from Existing Home owners wanting to tap the New Tax deductions ..
Tax system becomes Fairer for ALL Workers trying to Buy a Home.

Then the GST can be edged UP.. without Damaging consumer Spending Power .. if ALL Households can Claim Tax deductions on HOME LOANS.

If You can see this logic and Agree.. CALL your LOCAL MEMBER !!
