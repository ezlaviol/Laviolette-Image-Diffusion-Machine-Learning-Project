2016-06-24T20:14:00+10:00 : Still in for the ride. Still alive, though a bit bruised. 
I was not able to watch the train wreck as I had very limited exposure to the market today (of all days).  Just as well. Last I checked it was 10:30 and asx was up, bremain ahead. Next thing I knew, in the afternoon, market was in free-fall. 
Anyway, in my 5 minutes online I grabbed 500 of Nab @24.65 (not great but I had to work with very little time). Not sure if that was stupid or brave. Time will tell. 
That will be it for me for a while, I think. 
Interestingly, as I write FTSE 100 is only down 4.75%. So maybe this is a chance to get in cheap. On the other hand maybe Lurkin is correct and this is the beginning of a collapse. Who knows. Certainly not me. 
This on top of everything else happening (ALP may win yet) makes it too volatile to predict. 
Like I said before, imagine the trifecta: Brexit, Alp, Trump. That would be something to behold. One down,  two to go.
