See no good points since his appointment for staff, sholders, lenders, Australians, Board governance, market confidence, market transparency (the McKeon appointment), dividends, growth, NAB advertisements? Put the question this way, can you name anything good that he has done? Please consider selection bias, it has been four months, and the SP and confidence in NAB from staff, sholders, the market, the regulators, the customers has not got better, has it?Unless you like cuts, scissors, and horror movies? Perhaps appointment to a hair dresser company would have been more appropriate?
