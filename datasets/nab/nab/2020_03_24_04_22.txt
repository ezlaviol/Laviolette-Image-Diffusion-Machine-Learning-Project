2020-03-24T04:22:00+11:00 : My target $8 as I cannot see why it should go back or maintain $14 when the financial reporting is not done yet. The impact of most businesses closing plus the support the banks are giving to loan holders combined with the reduction of demand for borrowing can only impact the banks or any business as a matter of facts.During gfc wbc issued shares at $15 yesterday got some for less than 14 by error.the banks may have to raise capital to support their operation not expansion which would be a complete turn around business model.
