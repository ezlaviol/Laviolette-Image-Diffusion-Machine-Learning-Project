2019-10-12T11:19:00+11:00 : On a positive note, there was a small "break through" in the China-US trade talks yesterday - that managed a reasonable rally on the DOW overnight of over 300 points.One (of a few) issue that has dogged world markets including the ASX has been the trade war fiasco and if that situation is improving then we might get a flow through to NAB's SP moving forward.We are in an interrupted bear market and that should push through to the end of the year IF we get some positive results to overseas issues like the China-US trade problems and Brexit. Maybe a push up to $30 could be the result.Wish we were getting more information on the CML spin-off. That could be the icing on the cake. Has anyone heard anything more about it - other than it is likely to happen this financial year?
