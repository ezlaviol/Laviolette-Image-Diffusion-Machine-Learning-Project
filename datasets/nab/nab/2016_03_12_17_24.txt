2016-03-12T17:24:00+11:00 : Here's the NAB v CBA 1M Daily chart with MACD below. SP movement looks good here, although weekly volume getting a a bit lighter. That's okay cause it doesn't look overbought (to me) on the weekly. Looking for some consolidation here but the run up to Ex div date in May should put a floor under the price and hopefully position it for a move higher. Will of course hope for further growth!

Accumulating when I posted the following has turned out to be a pretty good trade already!

It's on Sale!

I bought more today, had a cheeky bid in since yesterday which got hit. Reallocated the funds I'll receive from CYBG with a couple of other divs into NAB. Only a small parcel.
