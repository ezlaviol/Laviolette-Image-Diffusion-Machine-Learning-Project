2019-03-19T12:24:00+11:00 : Lots of traders are shorting Banks and the number of shorts look increasing.We can not possibly know why the SP is not going higher but not may people will get excited with the future earning of these banks.There will be some buying at some point and I am waiting for that signal, with global markets going higher and higher it would be interesting if/when the big boys will at the end buy into index stocks.
