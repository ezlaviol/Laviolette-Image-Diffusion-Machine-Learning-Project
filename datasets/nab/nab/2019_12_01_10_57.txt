2019-12-01T10:57:00+11:00 : MissG - where do you see NAB's SP being at the end of the year?Do you think that ASIC's latest comments about further investigations into banks will materially affect bank SP's or has most of the "shock" already been factored in by investors?

NAB is getting close to the zone where buys become desirable , maybe just a few days away  .Capitualtion day would be great  where it seems the most " scary"  ..
