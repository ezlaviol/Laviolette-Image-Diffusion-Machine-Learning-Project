2018-01-19T21:54:00+11:00 : Na, December div . I bought 2,000 extra shares in 2017. July and nov. Iâ€™ve had a lot of extra funds from property settlements which are now all in top ups for blue chips. NAB has been the dud, however more than offset from a truckload of BHP and WPL I bought. But still up from older holdings in NAB overall.
