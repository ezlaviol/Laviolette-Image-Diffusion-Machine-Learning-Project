2020-03-30T12:28:00+11:00 : United Australia Party!!!! Clive doesn't look in the greatest of health and the majority of members are probably in the danger age group (>60). The only reason they will survive this crisis is if they follow the current directions and stay inside. The government is just sharing the pain around in a crisis that none of us caused however we will all be impacted in some way.If you were allowed outside at the moment I would suggest you need some time outside your bunker to get some fresh air.
