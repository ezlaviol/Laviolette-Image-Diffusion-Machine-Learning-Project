More than anything the BoE indicating an easing in rates next month giving markets some indication the UK is looking at mitigating the fallout of the brexit vote. Personally I think it will take more than a rate cut. The U.K. Needs to start fleshing out some trade deals asap. Next 4 weeks? Rallies have to end sometime and this one has been pretty big. Size of the retrace will tell a lot and the reaction of gold too. Was looking at gold stocks today but I don't think the selloff is done just yet and I'm not all that keen on buying non dividend paying stocks so they need to be a bit cheaper than where they are. That tree in the pic is the Aussie banks!
