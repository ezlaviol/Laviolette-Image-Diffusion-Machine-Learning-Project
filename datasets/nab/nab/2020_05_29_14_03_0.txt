It should be remembered that the 1st component of this raising was a placement to instos of $3b worth of shares (issued end April iirc). Highly likely a significant portion of those shares have been churned through the system to put a few pieces of silver in the pockets of the big boys. After those $3b worth of shares were issued NAB had no significant drop compared to its peers in this sector (And yes, I understand the big boys are pretty good at this sort of stuff).
The only time recently NAB moved differently to its peers was when it traded ex Div which the others did not have this year
Some retail holders will have also already sold the shares they wanted to fund/replace by the SPP.
I think it is highly likely that a much greater percentage of that $3b was traded than the expected selling of retail holdings as part of the $1.25b SPP.
I think if we drop to those levels again it will be due to another dip in economic sentiment and will be reflected in all the banks. (Bound to be quite a few bumps before we are out of this)
Only rider to that is if instos play some games (to try and get some more cheap shares to churn) but generally plenty of liquidity around to handle the sort of expected volume from retail selling their SPP shares.
