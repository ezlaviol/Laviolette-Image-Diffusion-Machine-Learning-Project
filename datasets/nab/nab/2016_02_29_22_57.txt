Short answer is no one knows.

Are banks doing well?  I think they are doing very well with record profit.  Will they  continue to do very well?  Possible but the odds are against them.

Markets always look forward and if the market thinks th e banks will be doing better in the future, share price will go up.  If the market thinks the bank will be doing worse in the future, share price will be going down.

The question is how long do you see your future?   1 month? 1 year? 1 decade ? Or 1 century?
