2020-08-03T07:51:00+10:00 : Prevailing sentiment is that there will be a market correction. The great unknown is how big or small that will be or when that is coming. It is quite possible that we will enter a period of stagnation with the markets going up and down on the spot rather than a dramatic collapse.Personally, I have no idea of what the next 6  months hold for us. Maybe the first six months of 2021 will be the period that determines where the share market is going more than the remaining portion of 2020. I think we are in the current situation where investors are in shock and don't really know whether to sell or to accumulate.There are some concerns for banks in the next 12 months for certain and I can't see NAB for example moving past $20 - I have a feeling that the SP may drop a bit to the $16-17 range. Thing is, my crystal ball is no better than anyone else's.Somewhere in the future (a changed version on what we know now), things will settle down and as we know that banks are essential in society, accumulation rather than selling is a strategic decision that makes sense. With that view in mind, an SP of around $17 is probably a fair price but it is also a wonderful price to buy into NAB.

Think you are destined never to own NAB shares then Eric. Can't see it falling to $13 but $10 is something we won't see.Good luck though.
