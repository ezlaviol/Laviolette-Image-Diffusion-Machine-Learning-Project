 I agree with your analysis.I'm invested in NAB already and will buy more shares, but not at the SPP.   I will wait a tad and see how things develop.  My investment strategy has always been medium term so if the price does go up a tad, I will not miss out on that much..   I definitely agree that NAB will prosper in the future - it's the timing that is a bit off.  Cheers.
