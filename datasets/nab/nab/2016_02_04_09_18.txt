i was buying NAB at the price of $26.7x's/.8x's in the last few weeks to grab a reasonable price for NAB even post demerger + get the Clydesdale stocks as a bonus which imo will be around the $4.20-4.50 mark in 6 months once the market stabilises + the IPO settles. I will look to sell then as i am not interested in holding a UK bank stock.
