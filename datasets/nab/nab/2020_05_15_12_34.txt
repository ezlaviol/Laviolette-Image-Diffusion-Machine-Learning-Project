My point comes from those who do not branch out beyond it, ie never take a risk, complain and moan about wages yet do nothing to better themselves or take risk to earn more - wage slavery. spread risk, compound blue chips dividends, and you can do quite well. Leverage up even - I have in the past. Biggest thing is discipline to keep compounding.
