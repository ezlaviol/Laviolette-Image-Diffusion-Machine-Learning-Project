This issue is worth discussing outside of HC to educate the ones who haven't been brainwashed already.  Hard to believe that many, probably most, people think that the government has a magic self filling pot of money to spend.The fact is the government taxes people a total of $X.  Companies don't eat and don't pay tax - people who own companies pay the tax one way or another.The current FC system has been in place 18 years and people have planned their future over that period.  The FC changes are inherently stupid but to make them at least fair, they should be grandfathered for 18 years.  Otherwise the policy creates different rules for different classes of people and nothing is worse than governments artificially setting one group against another.There are consequences of this BS 'us against them', 'make everyone equally poor in outcome', 'dependent on the government' philosophy.  BS will get in at the next election but how much BS will dump on us depends on how much of a majority he gets.Change to FC will be a negative for the sp of every company paying a franked dividend, share prices in general and everyone who owns shares which is basically everyone who posts or reads HC. It is ultimately futile - it will force people who are not on welfare onto welfare and the people they want to 'catch' will simply restructure.  The strategies to do just that are already being implemented given the almost certain ALP victory federally.
