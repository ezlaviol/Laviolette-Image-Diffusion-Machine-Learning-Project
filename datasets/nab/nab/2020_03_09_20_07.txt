2020-03-09T20:07:00+11:00 : Not sure if you are joking now.SP will normally drop by the value of the franked dividend in my experience but that is another story.Franking is 30% not 42.85% so not sure where you get that figure. Read what I wrote again - The $1 example I used was pre franking and I thought it made perfect sense.

I thought you receive $1 and then get franking credits of 42.85cents if 100% franked.  $1 divided by 0.7 gives $1.4285. which is the value of the two together.  You would often get the whole $1 but the share often drops by $1.4285.   but if I am wrong smarter people will correct me
