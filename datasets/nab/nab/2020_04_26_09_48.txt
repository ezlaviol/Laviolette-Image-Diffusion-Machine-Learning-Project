2020-04-26T09:48:00+10:00 : low deposit, existing high LVR and uncertain employment/business income I’m sure they wouldn’t touch you. I wouldn’t either. Especially when a likely 10-20% fall will wipe out the perceived equity of a highly leveraged residential property investor. It’s a perfect event for property to correct, conditions already there, just needed a catalyst. Residential is a horrible yielding asset class and no there isn’t any reason for prices to continue up. Immigration (main driver) is going to be crushed for a while.While I’ve bought banks on their existing business model during this crisis I expect subdued lending hence growth.
