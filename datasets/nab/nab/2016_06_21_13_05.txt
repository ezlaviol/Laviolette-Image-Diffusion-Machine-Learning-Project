2016-06-21T13:05:00+10:00 : I got out at 10.30am- made a good profit, wished I'd waited to about 12pm but looking at the numbers now very happy to be out.  That's the Brexit ride over I feel - thank you panicking market.

I agree Nanood, odds are a very good indication. There was really no Brexpanic before polls rocketed Remain up to $1.70- almost even money. The market over the last couple of days reflects Remain odds coming back to $1.27. 

In the same vein I don't agree the US election is having much influence, nor is the Aust election. With odds of Dems at $1.28 and Turnbull at $1.12, there is virtually no uncertainty. Also, the US election is too far away for the market's attention span to cope anyway I reckon.

Of course, a few polls in the wrong direction and odds changing, or outcomes against the bookies, which happens from time to time, and the market goes into a spin. Short of this, I think we're back to data watching- actually 'people watching data' watching.
