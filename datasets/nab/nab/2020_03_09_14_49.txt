If the DOW fall doesn't happen or it recovers from a terrible start like it did on Friday, we may have a big reversal tomorrow. I'm buying for the mid/long term anyway so I'm not too concerned about what Victorian sellers may do. A public holiday in one state shouldn't stop people buying or selling through any of the online traders anyway.
