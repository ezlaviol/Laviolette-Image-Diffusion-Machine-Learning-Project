2016-04-06T18:16:00+10:00 : Well... Anyone buying a few weeks back for $27-$28 is already down 10% of their capital. The cash in the bank plus 2%-3% interest is probably looking like a highly preferable option for those buyers right now.

We all think (and hope) that we can time our entry nicely and buy near the bottom But the point I am trying to make is that there is no rush. This market is highly volatile and what looks like a good entry today might look awful in hindsight, so keep some powder dry and there is absolutely nothing lost by simply sitting back and watching this market right now. Cash in the bank might make it easier to sleep at night.
