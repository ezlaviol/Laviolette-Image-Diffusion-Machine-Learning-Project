Honestly while I think they will certainly feel pressure to behave more ethically (which is a good thing) and will have greater "compliance" costs I have really never seen the government legislating any kind of whole sale changes which will greatly reduce the profitability of the "big 4". You could also look at it as NAB has less to lose in terms of SP as it didn't have the big run up that the other three did from about 11-15 due to the management errors. Also currently offering the highest dividend yield which will still be huge even if they need to drop it by a cent or two.
