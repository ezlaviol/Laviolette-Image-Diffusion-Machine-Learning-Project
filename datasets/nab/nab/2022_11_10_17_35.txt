2022-11-10T17:35:00+11:00 : I hope you don't mind my creating this thread - most stocks have a general discussion one.I had previously posted that one of the prominent stock commentators had referred to NAB as the 'worst performed' of the big 4, and I didn't agree. (In fact I wondered what planet he had been hiding on).He was on ****** again on Tuesday, and repeated the same claim while the 'team' were discussing WBC & NAB  He seemed so adamant that I wondered if it was to do with the time-frame.  So, I went away and did some amateur analysis on the 'big 4 minus CBA', and below is what I have come up with.I realise it's difficult to examine in detail (and it's just too hard to include dividends), but a 10 year graph of 3 entities is hard to get into a small space.  I'd appreciate other viewpoints, but if there is one conclusion I think can be drawn, it is that the mantle of 'worst-performed' big bank goes to ...... WBC by the length of the straight!  And, the best performed by the Â½ length of the course .... NAB!
