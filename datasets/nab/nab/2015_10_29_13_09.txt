2015-10-29T13:09:00+11:00 : Evan Jones seems to have a dislike of banks that verges on the pathological. His list of publications reveals his latest article was entitled "To fix Australia's banking culture: Start sending bank CEO's to gaol" - its not clear from his article whether we should put them up before any judges. Seems they should be locked away just for being capitalists. I guess that's fine if you've been in the same university department since 1973 and have probably never had a job interview or worried too much about budgets / profit and loss, etc.

Anyway - NAB giving out a good dividend and is looking at cleaning up its outpost interests. Anything around $30 looks pretty good to me.
