Small holders:1. uncertain job, on job keeper or lost their job entirely2. uncertainty meaning would rather hold $30k cash than equities in the quickest crash in decades 3. unwilling to take out a loan or draw down on mortgage in this climate for $30k.4. As a result of all of the above only put in a smaller amount $5-$15kSo I am hoping I get my full $30k across each account.
