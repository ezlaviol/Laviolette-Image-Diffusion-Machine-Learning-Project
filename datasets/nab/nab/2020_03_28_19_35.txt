I thought if a burger cost $15 say and uber eats adds $5 they both win; restaurant makes a sale it may not have otherwise and uber makes money on the delivery. As to the destruction of businesses under these totalitarian shutdowns, I totally agree - it's  king hit for a lot of businesses and employees right now. My gym manager called me up to say he'd been made redundant overnight and my membership was cancelled. However many this virus allegedly kills, I'd say the shutdown will kill a lot more through suicides/drugs etc.
