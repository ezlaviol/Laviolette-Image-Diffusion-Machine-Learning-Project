2018-01-15T10:40:00+11:00 : Iâ€™m hoping sombody will be dumb enough to sell me some for $28-$29. You never know the Aussi market seems to lag behind whatever is happening elsewhere, so maybe 10% F/F is on the cards sometime for 2018.  Rc helps me buy it cheap, really the likely outcome of a RC is millions spent in tax payer dollars and the banks taking in board suggestions as to how they can do it better while taking in record profits. Only major risk is QE, and nab is best placed of all the banks for this anyway. Imo, here....have a nut.
