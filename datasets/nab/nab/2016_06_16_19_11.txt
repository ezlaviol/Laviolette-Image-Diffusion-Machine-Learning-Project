Definitely getting red vibes for tomorrow. Looks like it's time to get some more very soon. Like some have posted here, I also think the biggest threat to nab SP is fear itself, rather than the fundamentals. So, still with one week to go till the Brexit vote, question is how low can it go? Will it beat the recent previous low of $23.82? Should I save some ammunition in case Brexit occurs, Trump wins (though nothing will save us then), or ALP wins? Too many options and my crystal ball is away being serviced . I will have to go to plan B, where is my coin....
