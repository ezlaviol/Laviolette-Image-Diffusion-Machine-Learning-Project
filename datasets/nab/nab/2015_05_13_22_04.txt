2015-05-13T22:04:00+10:00 : I love shorters like u, TeTeTe, wish there were more of u out there, only some of u r here in hotcopper trying to do in the oil & gas stocks and so forth, if there were more shorters in NAB, recoveries might be more dramatic in subsequent days, especially as it pulls back to $40 & beyond.
Shorters r good for volume on the more liquid markets, I wish there were more shorters on the ASX, the market is so clueless, the gains on the longs would be so tasty.
I wished more brokers could go bearish on the banks as well so more punters would sell & let me have em cheaper. Next business/ consumer confidence stats and quarterly results, then all these bank prices esp. the 4 majors will have fully recovered & phenomenal weekly gains on ASX "blue chips" will be no more. This caper used to occur on the NYSE, TSX and the LSE/ Deutsche Borse as shorting became garden variety. Now the algos have massacred them in the Tech Wreck and Great Recession. Good to see the ASX keeps old fashioned shorting alive and well. Just not enough of u to make windfall gains from.
