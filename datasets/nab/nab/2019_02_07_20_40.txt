Now now, the market has flopped and I need to have a tanty cause I lost my home.Perhaps only a select few nowadays plan worst case scenarios??? Common sense not so common?I agree 100% this sort of thing is no different from putting it all on red and hoping that ball stops on it. Any investment needs risk mitigation you dont do it dont come crying....
