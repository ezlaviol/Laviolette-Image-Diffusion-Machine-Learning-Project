2020-03-13T21:32:00+11:00 : To be fair I am running uncomfortably low on cash as a % of portfolio. However it’s not everyday you get a 30% plus crash in 3 weeks.ive been buying most steep days over the last 2 weeks in various stocks. I got another 500 nab low $19s or so I can’t remember exact price. Got some more TAH today too.it’s actually more depressing seeing capital of existing holdings fall than ‘buying perceived bargains’.
