2017-01-09T13:59:00+11:00 : The expected expansion of economic activity in the US is the key driver behind the bull run in the financial sector.

NAB hit 43.50 in 2007 and 39.58 in 2015. In both years economic activity surged in the US. IMO I think NAB can break 40. Trump will set US to work. His goal of creating employment and building infrastructure will grow the US economy and the financials will all benefit.

Plenty more to come here. IMO the best stocks for 2017 will be the Ozzie banks.
