It appears we really are in the times of the perpetually offended
Sam Kerr made a laughing comment against the critics of her side straight after the heat of battle of a come from behind win and I think she had every right to say it, good on her!
If NAB decided to cut sponsorship to a women's sport that needs it because of that feeble excuse I would be disgusted. They pump plenty into male sports sides incl AFL and Souths RL - heaven help us if someone from there is overheard swearing or the like.
It would either be pandering to social media hypocrites or an excuse to reduce sponsorship expenditure.
(I don't follow Soccer (do keep an interest in most sports) but happy to see the women's game produce some talent and confidence.........)
