2020-06-01T11:10:00+10:00 : One person in their 30's does not make a dying generation. That is just scaremongering.One thing though - I hope you are right and the SP hits $12. Just the right price for me to jump in and buy as many NAB shares that I can get hold of.Unfortunately, we will never see $12.

This gap has not been filled since 1993 and with covid19 now killing younger people in their 30s in Australia and schools being closed due to contaminated students when we are just coming out of it (with no cure) then the pandemic has only just begun. Unless there is a cure, social distancing will not last long with sexually active people. The ramifications of this are huge. Social distancing is slowing the spread but only a cure will fix the share price of banks. Staples is where you want to be in this market. Everyone needs to eat but nobody needs to buy a house when they've already living in one.  looking at nabs long term chart since 1987 I see a nice little gap staring me in the face from 1993 and nabs down ward spiral is heading straight for it and looks like it will hit within the next 2 years.
