2021-08-02T13:53:00+10:00 : You havent factored the DRP or cash dividend into the return.Its also easy to pick one of the best performing ASX stocks - CSL and compare it to the banks and poo-poo them.By that logic:If I invest in CSL today $295. Tomorrow its say 295.50If I go to the casino and put $295 on red, the same day if I win is $590. Doesnt necessarily mean its a better investment.All stocks list on ASX to try and grow thats why buffet says to invest in index funds as a greater good theory.Banks fall into too big to fail theory and this has been tested time and time again. Happy to park money here. If all the banks collapse the economy collapses - CSL with it.
