No doubt there will be a lot of retirees, like myself, on this thread that's interested on the topic of the FC changes. Probably more so on this thread as NAB is giving fairly good dividents and so far always
100% FC. I hope the mods will let this post thru for the benefit of no doubt quite a few here.

Re "Briefly.......... anyone on a full or part centrelink benefit as of 28th. March 2018 will retain franking credits. (Age Pensioners, Disability Pensioners, Unemployed, Carers etc etc.) ALSO if 1 member of a SMSF meets the aforesaid criteria the SMSF will receive franking credits."

I have further followed up on this issue. The above quote is correct, but my worry is that what if your port folio is just under the $800K mark and on a good market run, it may go over the pension threshold? My answer from Tanya Pliberek's office "I can assure you that you and your wife will continue to be eligible for cash refunds even if you come off the part pension, because you received pensions before 28 March 2018. I have confirmed this with both Chris Bowen and Bill Shortenâ€™s offices, so rest assured it is the correct advice.

Hope it helps those in a similar situation.
