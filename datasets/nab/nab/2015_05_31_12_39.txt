2015-05-31T12:39:00+10:00 : NAB did mention some weeks ago when they announced the demerger that existing NAB shareholders would get shares in Clydesdale. But no details were given.

At this stage 1:1 is meaningless, unless we know the number of Clydesdale shares that will be issued. Since it is much smaller than NAB, then they might issue a lot less shares and allocate a lesser amount per NAB share. That doesn't really make a difference, as it just means each Clydesdale share will be worth more the less that are issued.

I would hope the Clydesdale shares are dual listed so that we can sell them on the ASX and not need some special arrangement to sell.
