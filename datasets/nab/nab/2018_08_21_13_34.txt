2018-08-21T13:34:00+10:00 : T-bull may stand Taller vs Shorten, but he is just another sucker.  Not forget the bank levy - marking the start of bank SP down turn, not forget the RC and the LNG export ban ect.   A party should has some basic principles, seems to me neither majors have any.  Shorten was shouting 'Australia first' on TV when T-bull introduced the bank levy and more regulations for business.  

ASX has been more sensitive to Aussie FX than anything else for as many weeks - an indication of controlled by overseas funds.  Who cares?
