I suspect the mkt has an SOP that says they must sell when the RC is running.

I suspect the mkt has some skepticism from the coming ALP's plan to scrape off the franking credit refunds.

And for the least of all reasons, the mkt theorises there may JUST BE a dps cut.... due to NOT BEING ABLE TO SELL LOANS VIA BROKERS ANYMORE....
