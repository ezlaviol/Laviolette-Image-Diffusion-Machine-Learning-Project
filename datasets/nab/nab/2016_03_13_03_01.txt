2016-03-13T03:01:00+11:00 : NAB has actually had about nine outstanding trading days (from Feb 29), up around 15% in that time. It's good news for holders (about time I say) but those nine days are what gives NAB her superior one month and even three month performance against her peers.

Now... I'm not discounting the fact that NAB has had a good month (or three) but I'll reserve judgement until she can string (say) three quarters together or (God forbid) three years. The past has been poor, and she has ground to make up.

Disclosure: As I said in my original post, I'm still heavy in NAB, and have not reduced my position at all.
