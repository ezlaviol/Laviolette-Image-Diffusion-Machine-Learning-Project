2023-01-08T22:52:00+11:00 : In the last week, the National Australia Bank sold:1. $US1.15 billion of three-year fixed-rate bonds that pay US dollar investors a yield of 4.96 percent2.$US1.1 billion of five-year fixed rate bonds that pay US dollar investors a yield of 4.94 percent, and 3. $US1.125 billion tranche of Tier II bonds with a 10-year maturity yield 6.42 per cent.Can someone please explain:1. What impact these rates will likely have on short and medium term owner occupier and property investment rates (if any), and 2. Is the real yield higher because the rate needs to be converted from Australian dollars to US dollars.Thanks
