2018-01-02T21:00:00+11:00 : Not sure about $39 Fozza as that seems a bit too unrealistic with all due respect but I think somewhere between $31-$33 is almost a certainly by end of March.

This is my pick of the Banks by a country mile - I wanted to double my holdings today at $29.46 but couldn’t get out of AZJ in time - however I’m hoping it’ll give me another chance in the next day or so at similar levels.

Massive fan of this one at these prices....BARGAIN blue chip!
