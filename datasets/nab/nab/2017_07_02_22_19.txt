2017-07-02T22:19:00+10:00 : Don't rely on yahoo charting. They have so many mistakes. That yahoo chart is wrong. Correct chart indicates. NAB is down around 40% since 2008. CBA is up 100%. Not including dividends. CBA has and will continue to be the best bank to invest for the long run. NAB growth is slowing right now.
