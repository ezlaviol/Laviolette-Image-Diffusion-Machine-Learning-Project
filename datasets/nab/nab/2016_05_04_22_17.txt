2016-05-04T22:17:00+10:00 : Kiwiboy00 (Darren) your secret is safe with me, though I am surprised. I will not tell a soul bro.
All the best with your activities, whatever they may be; we are all here for the same reason after all. But you see, when it comes to NAB/ANZ at the moment if shorters win, I lose so I still hope you get burnt..... badly.... if you are shorting these at the moment.
Of course next week, my sentiments may change (though I personally do not short).

Seriously though, good luck tomorrow, and by the way I have enjoyed your posts and learnt from the questions you have asked.
