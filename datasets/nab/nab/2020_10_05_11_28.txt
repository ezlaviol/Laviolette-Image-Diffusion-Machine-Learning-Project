I agree with some of your rant and I especially like that he has stood up against the power of china's manufacturing where there has been decades of  neglect. I wasn't trying to pick a side of politics but more of a comment that a seemly unstable man with limited filters is in charge of the most powerful nations on Earth. That's scary, and to some degree more important than the economic impact of his policies. IMO.
