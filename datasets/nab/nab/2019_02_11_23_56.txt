2019-02-11T23:56:00+11:00 : It’s all about time frames.  If we go back 5 years to today, the price of houses in MELBOURNE and Sydney are up significantly.  The prices may have fallen 5 to 10 % from the highs but those that bought 5 years back are still significantly ahead.   It’s just like owning shares.  They never keep going up!!  Doomsday is always coming!!!!!
