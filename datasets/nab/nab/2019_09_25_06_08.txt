May have to wait a day or two for the $30 SP. It will come though.

Almost $4/Share Dividend in 2020. ($2 Normal Dividend plus Proceed from MLC Sales)..Worst cum worst NAB may drops to $28/Share on market weakness, then recover. ..Hang on for few years, forget $34/Share, NAB will beat CBA in terms of Percentage of Return on Investment.
