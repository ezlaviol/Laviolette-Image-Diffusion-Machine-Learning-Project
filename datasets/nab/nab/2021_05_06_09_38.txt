just keep it, NAB and kick it under the bed so to speak
and enjoy your franking credits

your without the dollars right now and in a couple of months, thats all
you will recover ....... then in a few years time after clicking the reinvest button
you will look
TWICE a year at your growth
you have compounding growth, (right under your bed)
and smile

yes of course the s/p and your investment goes up and down
so don't be alarmed
just ride it though
