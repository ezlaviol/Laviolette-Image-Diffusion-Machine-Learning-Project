Everyone is greedy sircorp - but not all have the you know whats to take up the challenge.Anyway, NAB is a long haul investment. I expect to recoup all expenditure on NAB in 10 years via dividends - even if they drop over the next 12 months. That is purely immaterial in the calculation. Capital value will double as well.We'll touch base in 2030 so you can tell me I was right and you were the other thing

Yes..Sadly Govt has allowed market to operate, every thing else there are restriction but not on market...However, those to getting sucked in suckers rallies are themselves to blame......Things are getting worse rather better, why should market rally ? Suckers Rally (Greedy people get sucked in).....Yes Wage will help people, but companies still will go down, mostly likely lots of company will take people wage from Govt and then declare bankrupt.
