2021-08-05T17:14:00+10:00 : I don't see the share buy back as "mismanagement of capital" I see it as a reduction in dilution and an increase in potential EPS and increase in remaining shareholders value. This to me works the same as a DRP or if I got the cash and bought more NAB shares. I also now dont have to deal with any tax consequence of this consolidation (at least not until I sell my position), which under an increased dividend would be a current year taxing issue. Berkshire Hathaway have done buy backs on numerous occasions.Not sure why its being looked at so negatively.
