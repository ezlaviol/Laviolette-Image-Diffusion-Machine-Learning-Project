Appears some on here might be fairly youngReduction in retail branch numbers has been a rather large issue for the Big 4 for at least 20 years and will be ongoing. Branch closures reached a high point quite a few years ago and provided much angst in many communities. Of course the Banks were smart enough to get a lot of closure out of the way and just wear the heat as it became a bigger and bigger political issue.We have also seen times where banks commit to retaining certain branches as NAB is doing now saying they will not close rural branches at least over next year.Naturally this is all because of the lack of use of retail branches for normal transactions while other (often overseas) institutions are able to provide very competitive on line services which are often promoted by the financial media without any recognition of the different cost structure.Retail branch networks have obviously evolved over the years and are less and less about money handling which is just a cost. It is painfully obvious by just going into a branch these days that it is not all about the elderly queuing up to draw out their pension - in fact most of the elderly rarely go to branches eitherNAB was redesigning branches many yeas ago for this rather obvious trend, reducing telling points and having more office / consultation spaces!Little doubt all the banks would like to close more branches however these days its steady as she goes and often it is about getting best use out of what is there, while playing the game.It is all about return and no doubt all the banks have long range plans to evolve their network to maximise return while trying to leverage off any competitive advantage branches might have.Overseas and non bank players have long had the advantage of having a low cost base (plus media support!!) and being able to actively cherry pick the high worth businesses (and customers) in particular sectors.To combat this banks such as NAB went down the path of creating industry specific specialist units which could operate more nimbly and react to industry specific industries without needing the branch network. (Such as Agri, Health etc)In the retail sector the banks already have separate business units (actively marketed as stand alone) to operate and compete purely in the on line market away from the branches (eg NAB's Ubank)While the Big 4 have obligations to provide retail facilities it is really only among themselves, however does provide ability to service the small to mid business sector.Despite what the media and some commentators would have us believe it is not all about Home Loans................
