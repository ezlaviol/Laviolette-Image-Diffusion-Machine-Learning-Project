That is the problem with these sort of stocks, up and and often unpredictable,  and can be heavily influenced by big players. The clever players can go in and out and make good gains day by day. I can't move that quick so I have to be careful. I will just hold that one for a while, it should do alright over the next few months. While I am green I am happy .

Anyway, thatâ€™s why I like banks. They move slower, you won't lose all your money and if it doesn't go your way the dividends can keep you warm. Speaking of which thanks Nab.

Tomorrow I am thinking red (I am trying to use reverse psychology on Mrs Market , let's see if it works). You hear that Mrs Market, I am saying you will be down.
