2022-03-08T21:00:00+11:00 : Graphic: Global asset performance http://tmsnrt.rs/2yaDPgn Graphic: World FX rates http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh 	World stocks held at a one-year low on Tuesday, while gold climbed above the key $2,000 level, as the prospect of a ban on Russian oil imports pushed up oil prices and raised concerns of soaring inflation and slowing economic growth.  	President Joe Biden's administration is willing to move ahead with a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports even if European allies do not, U.S. sources indicated, while Russia warned that prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halts oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine.	  	International oil benchmark Brent crude  LCOc1 , which briefly hit more than $139 a barrel in the previous session, was up about 2.6% at $126.42. 	Still, with Europe rejecting plans to ban energy imports, there was some relief and European stocks picked up more than 1% in early trading, although some analysts said that may be a temporary reprieve.  	Since mid-February, European banks have lost a quarter of their share value and an earnings hit looks inevitable  .SX7P . 	After the S&P 500's worst day since October 2020  .SPX , Wall Street futures pointed to more losses.	   	"The price action appears to reflect building concerns over a sharper slowdown/recession for the global economy on the back of the energy price shock," Mizuho strategists said in a note. 	The MSCI world equity index  .MIWD00000PUS , which tracks shares in 50 countries, was down 0.2% and has lost 10% since early February. It was down as much as 0.5% in early Asian trading, hitting its lowest level since March 2021. 	An Asian stock market gauge  .MIAPJ0000PUS  lost 1% in afternoon trade, tracking a bruising Wall Street session with Japan and Hong Kong leading losses. 	"Clearly oil is in the firing line now from both sides. And there's a little bit of brinkmanship as to who can threaten whom when it comes to oil imports or exports," said Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at IG Australia. 	Price action in the currency markets reflected increased investor nervousness with the U.S. dollar advancing against the Aussie  AUD=D3 , signalling traders were becoming increasingly pessimistic about the global growth outlook. A currency market volatility gauge  .DBCVIX  jumped to a two-year high. 	U.S. crude  CLc1  ticked up 1.8% at $121.55 a barrel, while prices of many other commodities, including nickel, continued to rise as industrial buyers and traders scramble as the Russian-Ukraine conflict shows no sign of cooling. 	UBS Global Wealth Management is recommending a neutral stance on equities and advising clients to hold commodities, energy stocks and the U.S. dollar as portfolio hedges in the short term. 	The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  US10YT=RR  rose to 1.8369% compared with its U.S. close of 1.749% on Monday. The two-year yield  US2YT=RR , which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 1.5947% compared with a U.S. close of 1.548%. 	The rally in oil and other commodities prices will only add to the global inflationary pulse with data this week expected to show the U.S. Consumer Price Index climbed a stratospheric 7.9% on a year-on-year basis in February, up from 7.5% in January. 	With the outlook for European growth darkening, the euro  EUR=  was up 0.1% on the day at $1.0857, after taking a beating and falling 3% last week to its lowest level since mid-2020. 	The dollar index  =USD , which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, was steady at 99.212.
