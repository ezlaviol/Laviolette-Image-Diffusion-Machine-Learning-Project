Interesting we both have an eye on the same stocks right now.
I was stopped out of WPL today though will get back in as soon as I think their short slide has stopped.
Am watching DMP keenly to see it strengthen a bit more before buying and also closed NAB today as they have had a short, quick run up for a decent profit. Again I will look to getting back in maybe as early as tomorrow.
The only other stock I like right now is NWS as I expect them to keep heading north.
Good luck with your trading,
Mikey
