2016-06-26T11:29:00+10:00 : Can't see any bounce on Monday being maintained. With the initial shock out of the way I'd think we will be in a more of a holding pattern. Might work its way down a bit more on market sentiment and little bit of worry creeping in about future ramifications. Had a chat with my father yesterday about pulling his money out of the markets on Monday and I doubt he is the only older Australian with those thoughts on his mind. Can't say I had any helpful advice. If you can't sleep at night you probably shouldn't be in the markets anyway. Still, money in the bank is a good place to be right now....
