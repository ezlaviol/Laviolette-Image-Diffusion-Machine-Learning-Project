2019-06-18T07:11:00+10:00 : I am not equating sponsorship with gender!!
If you actually read my post I was pointing out that NAB already sponsors the male dominated side of other major sports and cutting sponsorship to women's soccer because of these innocuous comments is ludicrous (and conversely would actually be seen as gender driven) Hate to see it if you ever get wind of various misdemeanors in other codes
I have read some bizarre stuff on HC but suggesting a Sam Kerr off the cuff comment moved NAB's Sp in opposite way to other banks takes the cake.
You obviously have a vendetta against NAB and use any minor issues to make some sort of point.
I realise I have been sucked into this argument when I should know better so will leave you to stew in your anti NAB (and now apparently Kerr) rhetoric.
BTW - If Sam Kerr is charged with murder I am sure Soccer Australia will act and presume NAB probably won't have to even comment on an ex Australian Captain............
