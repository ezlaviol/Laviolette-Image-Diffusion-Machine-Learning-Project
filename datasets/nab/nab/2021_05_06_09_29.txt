2021-05-06T09:29:00+10:00 : Congratulations 310843B! That is awesome. I 100% agree with your approach. Patience over the long haul, a bit here, a bit there consistently. I’m investing about 20% of my wage every month plus any bonuses (such as stimulus or tax return). Plus DRP.  I just started in 2019 (I’m in my 30’s). Hopefully I’ll be like you.
