2018-03-05T09:08:00+11:00 : Hi All,
I have tried various systems and have found candlestick signals to be the most profitable
Re NAB I bought them on a distinct Bullish Engulfing pattern only so I ignore all the noise around stocks like the banks at present. I look for a signal to trade.
I bought DMP on Friday on the same pattern.
Re HVN and any other blue chip stocks that get hammered, I watch them until  I see a clear reversal pattern.
If any of you have the interest take a look at Bulkowski candlestick trading patterns.
They include accuracy rates etc.
All I know is that he retired at 32 from trading candlestick signals making him just a bit smarter than me!! Just a bit??
Either way I have found these signals to be the most accurate predictor of future trends.
Good luck to you all,
Mikey
