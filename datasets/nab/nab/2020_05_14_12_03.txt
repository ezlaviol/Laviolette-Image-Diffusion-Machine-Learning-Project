You could phone the psychic hotlineâ€“ I hear they give good financial advice as well. In all seriousness TA has cause and effect around the wrong way. The line will follow the success of the company, not the other way around. The reason TA sometimes works is because great companies tend to follow that upward trend because their earnings continually grow. Perhaps an argument could be made that finding companies with an uptrend over many years, like CSL, RMD or ASX, will be successful. They have a history of growing earnings and the trend often continues. However, to suggest that you know what is going to happen in the next few months using a whole lot of lines on a random/chaotic data set is a mathematical fallacy.Sorry for the rant, but nobody knows where the NAB share price is going short term. Perhaps it will go to $10 if things get really bad, or maybe $20 if conditions improve.
