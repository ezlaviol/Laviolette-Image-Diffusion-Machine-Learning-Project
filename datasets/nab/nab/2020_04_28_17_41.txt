From a business perspective agree, but you could also apply the same lens to all the support the banks are providing for covid (and the bushfires) 

The banks are helping the government keep the country going no doubt. 

If we apply your logic, the banks should insist all interest payments are kept up to date and repossess when anyone falls into arrears. 

Imagine the outcry and bank bashing that would be led by our Politicians no doubt.

It’s a balancing act and post royal commission I think the banks are trying hard to do the right thing for the community, even if it is to the detriment of the organisation.
