2020-05-22T16:18:00+10:00 : I did the BPAY today...anybody know when we get to know how many shares were allocated and will it automatically reflect in the chess holdings (I use CommSec). Also Why is this being sold a dollar plus lower than current price I wonder....it seems a no brainier to buy and sell for a 10%+ return right? Anybody can throw some light on this?
