2020-04-29T13:10:00+10:00 : I remember back in Nov/Dec 2008 when NAB raised capital to strengthen it's balance sheet and improve it's tier 1 capital ratio there was NO SCALE BACK and it was only aiming to raise $250 million from retail investors... There was also a $3 billion placement with institutions prior.https://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/announcements.do?by=asxCode&asxCode=nab&timeframe=Y&year=2008Refer to announcement 18 Dec 2008I think NAB are seeking to raise $500 million from retail investors on this occasion so may be there will be no scale back.... I'm not convinced the majority of people will have the spare cash ($30k) at this time given the amount of people that have lost jobs or forked out on other capital raisings.
