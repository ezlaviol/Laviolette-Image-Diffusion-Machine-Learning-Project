2020-03-11T14:22:00+11:00 : Aussie Banks did not pass last two rate cuts, only recent one is passed means Aussie Banks are sitting at healthy margin of 2 percent...Also as per NAB market trading update few weeks back, NAB is doing pretty well financially..Only worry is if lots of SME goes burst, so far there is no chance of that happening in Australia
