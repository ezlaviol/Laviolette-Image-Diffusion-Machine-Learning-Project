2018-02-27T18:04:00+11:00 : It’s been a fantastic run back up which I predicted but I decided to cash in my chips at $30.47 as I wanted to buy a couple other stocks.

I still think it’ll get to $31 by end of March by the way but wanted to buy more WPL on today’s weakness and more DMP at these levels.

Will he watching closely and may get back in if I’m wrong and it corrects.
