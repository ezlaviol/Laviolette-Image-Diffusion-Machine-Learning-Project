So say you hold 2000 shares and for simplicity sake the dividend is $1. Then it is $2000/weighted price = no of extra shares you get issued in the DRP. If the weighted price was say $28 then it'd be 2000/28 = 71.42. As a result you'd get 71 shares issued to you (on the dividend payment date) they round down to a whole number and any residual dividends are carried forward to the next period.
