2016-04-21T10:44:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, April 21 (Reuters) - Australia's biggest banks on Thursday announced measures to protect consumers and increase transparency following a series of revelations about misconduct and ahead of a federal election set to be fought partly over calls for tougher sector oversight. 	The package includes reviewing product sales commissions, supporting whistle-blower employees and removing individuals from the industry for poor conduct, the Australian Bankers Association (ABA) said in a statement. 	"This plan delivers immediate action to make it easier for customers to do business with banks, including when things go wrong," ABA Chief Executive Steven Munchenberg said in a statement. 	The plan, parts of which are subject to regulatory approval or legislative reform, would be overseen by an independent expert.  	Australia's four major lenders - National Australia Bank (NAB), Commonwealth Bank (CBA), Westpac (WBC) and ANZ Banking Group (ANZ) - rode out the 2008 financial crisis with barely a scratch, but are now facing mounting criticism over alleged misconduct including rate rigging and insurance scams. 	Political pressure is piling on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to order a sector-wide inquiry into bank conduct as he campaigns for a federal election in July.  	The government announced reforms to the markets watchdog on Wednesday, aiming to head off malfeasance at financial institutions before it occurs.
