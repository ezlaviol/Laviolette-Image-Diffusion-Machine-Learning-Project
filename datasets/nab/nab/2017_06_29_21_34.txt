You would be down around 40%(not inlcuding dividends). However if you bought CBA at the same time. You would be up around 100%(not including dividends). You tell me which one would have been a better investment. All I am saying. NAB is not growing and has not done so for a very long time. Why would you invest in such a business. When you will get a lot more for you buck with say CBA.
