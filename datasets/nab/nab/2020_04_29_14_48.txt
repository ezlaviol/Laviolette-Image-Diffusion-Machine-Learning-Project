2020-04-29T14:48:00+10:00 : I think most have referred to the more recent SPP when talking about previous scale back.
Aug 2009 NAB raised $2b by placement and was seeking $750m from retail at $21-50 ps. They had applications for $2.6b  so it was heavily scaled back. (Max per appln as per the rules in 2009 was $15,000.) 
Obviously both these raising were in relation to capital requirements during GFC and toward end 2009 things were looking rosier.
Hard to gauge amount of free money around and also there are a lot of other companies who will be raising but I would expect a scale back
