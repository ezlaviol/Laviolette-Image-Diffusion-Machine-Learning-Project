Now be good citizen and keep unemployed for the sake of the .03% fatality rate with with the current chances of actually getting Rona at about 1% that of getting struck by lightning.  I have no opinion so it’s not financial advice anyway lol. But no the banks probably won’t increase profits while nobody can work and get income... Funny that...
