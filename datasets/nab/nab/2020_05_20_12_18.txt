2020-05-20T12:18:00+10:00 : 22nd of May for most.It does close early for some. The ones who are in control of their own super without a HIN. BT Super (Westpac) have closed their offer on the 19th of May due to "paperwork".Managers tanking the share price, I don't think it even matters at this price.
