I would rather let some "nice" prices pass me by and stockpile my cash atm tbh.It also doesnt really matter how many people have been left unemployed. Considering its already known the entire travel industry has been wiped out with only medical/government official travel its not rocket science that this has knock on effects. ie The shops at the airport, flight centres, travel insurance companies. What about all the tourism as a result of this "no travel" they are knock on effect number 1. Not to even begin mentioning the restaurants, cafes, gyms etc etc that are all closed. They all have suppliers they usually pay and dont need to, they will also be squawking for rent/lease relief.The only information that markets are relying on atm is infection rates/death rates which we can see people keep posting, some of these figures are being misreported especially when testing kits arent been handed out willy-nilly. I would be far more concerned about lock down periods as these have a far larger impact on the economies health than old mate dying in a nursing home.
