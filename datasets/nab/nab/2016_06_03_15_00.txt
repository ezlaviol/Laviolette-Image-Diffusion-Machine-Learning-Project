2016-06-03T15:00:00+10:00 : SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, June 3 (Reuters) - Australian and New Zealand shares rose on Friday, in line with Wall Street, as investors bet on an upbeat U.S. jobs report, while gains in key commodity prices drove up resource stocks. 	Markets expect U.S. employment data to show a non-farm payroll increase of about 164,000 and 0.2 percent rise in average wage earnings in May. 	The prices of oil and base metals, meanwhile rose, creating support for resource and energy stocks. 	At 0431 GMT, the S&P/ASX 200 index (xjo) was up 33.8 points, or 0.6 percent, at 5,312.7, clawing back most of the previous day's losses. After its worst start to a year in decades, the benchmark is now up 0.6 percent for 2016 so far. 	Banks led the advance amid hopes the stocks will be more attractive if Australia cuts interest rates for a second time in 2016, which will boost the economy by lowering borrowing costs.
