2015-05-13T19:37:00+10:00 : TeTeTe, ur plain vanilla capital raisings r of that kind, totally agree.

But this NAB capital raising is because the regulator, APRA, is completely lacking comprehension of the conservatism of the stress tests of global regulators such as the Bank of International Settlements in Basel and its Basel II/III accord. As a result, NAB is being cautious and dealing with a regulator that makes the banks in Australia overly conservative, over-capitalised and with the full recourse mortgages, safe beyond reason.

It is good in a way but a bit constraining to CBA, WBC and ANZ. As for NAB, once the dog investments in US, Northern England and Scotland r done away with, the growth potential should be relatively unrestrained. It is the business bank as well although ANZ may also claim that mantle.

It is quite positive for the banks at the moment, especially after the Federal Budget, NZ economic expansion (Australian banks have YoY growth in NZ) and Asean (ANZ's support base.

NAB is the pick, business and consumer confidence might keep its run past $40 going.
