2016-06-16T20:24:00+10:00 : I think the major damage from 2008 was the surprise at its severity, banks wouldnt lend to each other, whole countries (iceland) where cut off, i cant see that happening again, even if we get a deep global recession, it wont happen so fast, so it wont have that shock value. 2008 was a once in a lifetime event IMO.

But i have a lot to learn about banks, so just my opinion.
