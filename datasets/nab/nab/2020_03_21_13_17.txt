At some stage investors will not keep their money hidden in cash and in banks providing measly returns. That money will come back into the market. As for the actual economy. I used 6 months as a timeframe that looks beyond this acute pandemic. I don’t think it will take that long. In my opinion we will get through this much faster. Something will give, whether it is a treatment or drug to mitigate the effects or it will slowly die out as we head into summer for northern hemisphere. This will be a short term impact. Banks are already allowing businesses and home owners to reprieve from paying back loads for 3-6 months. That will help. I am sure other service providers will do the same in the short term. I am intrinsically an optimist and therefore do not see this pandemic turning into the gloom that some naysayers predict. Look at Germanys viral stats. Their death to infections are very very low. Look at Australia.At some stage soon the fear will subside. I mean look at China. They are cranking up business again.  They have pulled through. It didn’t take 6 months.
