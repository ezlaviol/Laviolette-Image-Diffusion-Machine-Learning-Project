2019-12-15T19:56:00+11:00 : lol how does a bank make more money:a) increasing the amount it lends, only problem neither business nor consumers are increasing the RATE of borrowingsb) increasing margins on lending, unfortunately with the reduction in RBA rates and increased competition from non-bank lenders, net interest margins are declining.c) increase their leverage, unfortunately regulators are requiring banks to hold more capital which reduces leverage.All of these factors are lowering the banks RoE.A lower RoE means that the fair value against the banks book value declines.banks seem moderately overvalued therefore on a fundamental basis.however with rba interest rates so low, on a dividend yld basis they seem about fair.buy dips but don't chase price
