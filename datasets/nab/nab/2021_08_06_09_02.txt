Prior to COVID NAB had a plan and due to COVID the plan of simplification to improve services and reduce cost is most probably ahead of plan. Re ASIC they need to focus on the changes around Money laundering. Once this hurdle is cleared I can see the NAB SP going beyond $28 and most likely break $30 in the next 18 months IMO.
