2019-01-07T14:50:00+11:00 : I work in tax. The franking credit aspect isnt that they wont be usable its that labor want them to become non-refundable tax offsets. Its quite ironic that Bob Hawk and Paul Keating (former labor PMs) introduced franking credits to reduce double taxation. Now a shadow of a once great party labor are sooking and want to partly remove it..... If your wealthy all your franking credit (think of it as prepaid tax by the company in which you own shares) is used anyway (high income tax rate) so it wont effect you. But if your a senior on low income (under ~$21,000) or slightly more with SAPTO you will no longer get a frank credit refund for tax paid on the dividend even though your income is tax free - so poor seniors look out. Why are labor trying to help out the wealthy? Very unusual....
