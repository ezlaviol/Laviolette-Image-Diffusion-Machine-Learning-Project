KEY POINTS

Texas health authorities said 2,153 patients are sickened with Covid-19 in its hospitals, making Wednesday the third-straight day of record-breaking coronavirus hospitalizations.
The new total is up from 2,056 patients on Tuesday and 1,935 patients Monday, according to updated data from the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
The steady rise in coronavirus hospitalizations in Texas will likely add to scrutiny from some U.S. lawmakers and infectious disease experts that some states opened businesses too early as the virus continues to spread throughout parts of the country.
