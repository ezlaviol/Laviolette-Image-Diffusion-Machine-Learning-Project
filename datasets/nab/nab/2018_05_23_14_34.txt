2018-05-23T14:34:00+10:00 : I'm thinking some of the super funds are having a mini-run and they selling the most of liquid stocks until the demand slows? Banks are tightening up and borrowers are hitting their super funds? Just a gut feeling only..no facts come available yet. 

Anyone have another explanation?
