2016-02-10T12:40:00+11:00 : I'm watching NAB thinking "getting cheap"  in the $24 range but then I look at CBA and she is green today! Just reinforces to me which stock I would prefer to be holding more of, and I'll be putting the CYBG into CBA most likely.

Having said that, I've put the cue in the rack for now as I think this is only the beginning of a big leg down for the banks and I think I'll be buying CBA about $10 cheaper within 3-6 months. I'll look at possibly buying some more NAB when the blood is really on the floor but not exactly sure when that might be - sub $20 perhaps?
