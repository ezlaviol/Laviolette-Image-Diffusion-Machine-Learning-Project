2019-06-19T21:55:00+10:00 : after CBA at below $80 AUD started going up, NAB at below $27 was probably next, NAB seemed to be next Big 4 Bank that had been oversold, Now they have corrected.Now only ANZ and WBC remain oversold and NAB and CBA are getting close to fairly valued IMHO.with the Aussie economy almost demanding negative interest rates, real concerns with Engineers Australia and the lack of engineering standards in the Opal Towers and Mascot Towers disasters that could spread to high rise apartments in Sydney not to mention fire cladding in Melbourne ala Grenfell Towers In London, I think there are some property concerns on the horizon.However without negative interest rates yet in Australia, the Big 4 banks will probably do very well and continue to produce these franked dividends and capital growth for some time to come. They including NAB seem to be in better shape than Wells Fargo, Citi, BofA, JP Morgan, HSBC, Barclays at least at this point when the RBA has the interest rate set so high.
