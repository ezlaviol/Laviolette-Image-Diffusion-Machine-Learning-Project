2018-11-19T14:26:00+11:00 : i hear u, always a personal thing
my head says if you spend everyday then u also prolly top-up with $200 a month anyway (eg salary in), and my head also says that if u spend every day then prolly do 1 tap a week as well (so no need to monitor either account to meet the rules)
 ...... ubank does not use poli (i do not know if me does)
good luck with whatever suits.
