2016-09-05T12:00:00+10:00 : NAB could go to $35 if there is more of a chance of negative rates in Australia.

With negative rates, where are Australians and Chinese who can get their money out of PRC for properties in Northern Shore of Sydney and SE Melbourne going to put their money? Not the ASX, presumably by this morning's lacklustre trading after a strong pro-equities result in US on Friday.

I can't see why the property market in Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland would go down. Defaults? Unlikely. Capital controls? Unlikely IMHO. Smaller big bank lending? Unlikely as it would make the retail portfolios and house prices more sustainable, unlikely to cause them to drop IMHO but pls DYOR.

Of course outside of Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland, there will be an enormous multitude of problems but demand for property in Upper Northern Shore of Sydney, SE Melbourne and Auckland is far more material than all of those places where the lending will not be growing to cause the defaults in any event.
