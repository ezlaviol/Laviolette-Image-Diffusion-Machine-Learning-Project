2020-03-13T11:03:00+11:00 : Well.... That all escalated rather quickly...Two weeks ago I purchased what I thought was an absolute bargain! Current evidence tells me I have been better off with a few nights of booze, heavy gambling and Ladies of questionable repute, then investing whatever was left over into shares. Ah well, at least I have no hangover!I think even a zombie apocalypse or alien invasion would have been less of a crash than this exaggerated tiny sniffle that has semantics collapsed perfectly good share portfolios at fire sale prices... Please at the very least offer zombies in the next correction as this one is embarrassing.
