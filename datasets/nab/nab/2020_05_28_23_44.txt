2020-05-28T23:44:00+10:00 : Vagabond, there will be plenty more opportunities!I was buying in $15’s and selling in $16’s and $17’s.Patience is the key to bank stocks at the momentas thy are so manipulated by the big end of town.        We will see a pullback, there is still plenty of bad news to come. I have my holding stock, but like youI’ve sold my trading stock at $17. In two years time this will be a $30 share, but for thenext six months there will be many ups and downswhich also means so many opportunities and missed opportunities along the journey!
