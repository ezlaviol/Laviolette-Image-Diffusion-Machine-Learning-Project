I personally disagree with what will outperform cash in a short time frame of 1 year, as your 2% cash in the bank is then fully taxed yet your current 10% dividends from the banks are fully franked! 

Maybe if your scared of a paper value going down in the short term you should limit yourself to watching share price movements, instead you could focus more on the income it will generate compared to cash.
