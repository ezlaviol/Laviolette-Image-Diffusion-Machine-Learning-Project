2016-06-11T19:07:00+10:00 : While i suspect we are completely different speculators (i.e, you sound sane), I took GXY off my watch list because I was tracking it, woosed out and didn't invest (cough- bet) and saw it soar. Same with VRC. Oh well, it happens.

Yes buying glee in the banks but I'll run out of amo if it drops another five percent and then I'll be crossing my fingers. I'm doing it through options as well just in case it's not exciting enough. Options are great but make the whole averaging down game a bit tense! Trying to beat the market and the clock  

Options are only part of my strategy of course, despite my very limited capital. The volatility *and* the change in volatility has been kind to me so far.
