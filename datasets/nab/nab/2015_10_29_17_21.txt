2015-10-29T17:21:00+11:00 : I was ready to hit the buy button today, but my WOW buy trigger got hit and I thought I should wait and see what tomorrow brings.

With NAB down a whopping 4% today on the back of about 2.8% yesterday, she should go sub $30 tomorrow (based purely on guesswork) and I am licking my lips at the thought of them apples.
