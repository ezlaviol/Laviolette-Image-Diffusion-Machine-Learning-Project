What you are doing is what I had planned to do, but for one reason or another things didn't turn out that way and I found myself off the bank bus.

I think NAB around 27 is pretty good value, and below 25 excellent value. Not sure it will get there this year, so just have to wait. There is however one bank that is on the nose atm and I have taken the opportunity to start accumulating and get back to the original plan. It could keep me busy for a while. Which bank you say ? I am sure everyone can figure it out.
