Especially those $300k+ utterly useless those bigger size cats just getting the money. ceo unfortunately if anything goes pear shaped he will bear the "burden" and he will be out of the whole game all together. Perhaps that's what justify the high pay nowadays? but still most of that goes to taxes. I only pay myself $80k from my companies lol
