Australian banks' coffers are swelling up on the back of surging interest rates since last year, although increasing living costs, softening home prices and a cooling economy pose threat to credit growth and paves way for more bad debt. 		NAB said net interest margin - the difference between interest earned from lending and paid for deposits - came in at 1.77% for the half year.		NAB reported cash earnings of A$4.07 billion ($2.72 billion) for the six months to March 31, compared with A$3.48 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected A$4.15 billion, according to Refinitiv data.   	The lender declared an interim dividend of 83 Australian cents per share, up from 73 Australian cents apiece a year earlier.   ($1 = 1.4990 Australian dollars)
