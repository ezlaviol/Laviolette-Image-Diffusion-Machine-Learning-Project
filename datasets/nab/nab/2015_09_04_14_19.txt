2015-09-04T14:19:00+10:00 : It's a buy today IMHO, but I would only be putting in (say) 30% of the cash set aside for buying, and wait out this month to see what else falls from the tree. If global markets keep doing the same thing for the next 1-2 months you might see much cheaper prices and pick a few more up when you think it's a good idea.
