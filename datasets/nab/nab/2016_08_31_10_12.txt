2016-08-31T10:12:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Australia's opposition leader on  Wednesday moved a motion for a sweeping public inquiry into the  banking system following a series of allegations of misconduct  including financial planning scams and insurance fraud.  	Bill Shorten told the parliament which returned on Tuesday a  Royal Commission was the only avenue that had the necessary  coercive powers and jurisdiction to deal with bank misconduct.  The government has opposed such an inquiry.  	A Royal Commission is the most powerful investigative body  in Australia, convened in recent years to address institutional  child sexual abuse and corruption in the building trades, with  the power to recommend prosecutions and new legislation.
