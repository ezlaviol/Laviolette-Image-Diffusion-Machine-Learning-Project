I can’t really see it heading down leading into the dividend with yield hitting near 10%. If it does I will be hitting a margin loan as it pays for itself and then some. It could dip to $28 for a bit or it could just as easily swing to $32 from here. All I know that Australia market is so lame that it can’t seem to follow the US with the same kind of up movements anywhere near as much as the down.
