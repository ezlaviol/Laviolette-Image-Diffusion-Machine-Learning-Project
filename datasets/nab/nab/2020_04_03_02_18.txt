You have been trying to talk down the SP for quite a while now."those who buy and hold they will suffer" - I know this is a technical point but you have a sentiment of HOLD - you don't see that as slightly contradictory?Take your blinker off - and have a look at the market - everything down (NAB is not more than other shares) and there are international things going on that had more to do with the drops than what you dream about.
