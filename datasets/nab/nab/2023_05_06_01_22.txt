2023-05-06T01:22:00+10:00 : Thought pretty much the same. After falling some 5% yesterday and this morning when i saw it at another 3% i put my order in which was substantial, the CommSec average buyin at 25.878 to me was a gift.Could it fall further, well yes but as a trade for a big bank to fall 8% on numbers i thought were pretty good, Phil Chronican & Ross McEwan are well suited to dealing with the parasites in ASIC & AUSTRAC who are just mandated to chasing money down and creating regulatory & compliance costs to pay for the woke left wing Budget and spending of our drunken sailors now at the helm.Cash increase 12.3%Profit before bad debt expenses up 18.5%Benefits of higher cash ratesNIM of 1.77% as apposed to 1.63%Business & private banking better than what i thought would have been with a payout ratio of 64%...conservative but whats wrong with that *?*An impact on net income interest down 3% to be expected, thought it would be worse and bad debts of lets say around 0.12% so possible upside of 8% to 10% quite probable so full year payout of 1.70 to be excitable if not probable.AFR was bantering Tier 1 ratio under the regulators new capital framework of 12.2% above minimum of 10.25% and whats wrong with that *?* PE of 11 & yield of 6% give or take ( + - ) .25% whats wrong with that knowing you can sleep at night knowing it will not go broke over night....can you sleep well at night GDAN ??? I know i can, so it was a buy for me for any stock like this when it has been hit with an 8% fall.....RDD
