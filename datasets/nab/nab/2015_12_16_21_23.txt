2015-12-16T21:23:00+11:00 : rona142 I agree and psi81, interesting take. I'm also a small holder.

From the documents:
Expected shares on issue immediately following demerger: 879,315,256

From 3.13.3 Table 10, CYBG HFI Balance Sheet at 30 September

Total Assets: 38,705
Total Liabilities: 35,262
Net Assets: 3,443 

~$4 ???

Very amateur and blunt analysis. (DYOR)
You'll want to season that valuation with some income estimates, interest on customer loans and intangibles.

"The anticipated nominal value of a CYBG Share immediately prior to the CYBG Capital Reduction is expected to be £1.25 (“Anticipated Nominal Value”)." Page 115.

Would that put a floor at ~$2.61AUD at todays exchange rate ???
