99 cents may be a possibilty this time around but do you believe it is sustainable? Anybody's opinion on the below are most welcome.

1. NAB short to medium term plan execution risks.

2. Cost of borrowing funds: This will probably continue higher albeit at a slower pace. US growth came in really strong but inflation seems to be stabilising therefore probably leading to slower pace for interest rate hikes.

3. Aussie Real Estate: Continues to fall and there are a number of article in media showing growing number of listings week on week. Number of households with low or no equity on the rise. Out of cycle rate hikes & tighter leading standards probably going to add more pressure. But it doesnt look like the sky is falling either.

4. Low wage growth continues to be an ongoing issue leaving households with cash flow issues.

5. Lower growth figures in Aussie service sector. Doesnt instill positivity about business lending.

6. Biggest risk, our wonderful govt that cannot seem to go one way or another.

For all sharing their opinions, thanks in advance.
