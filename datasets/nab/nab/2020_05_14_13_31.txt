Australia's unemployment rate jumped to a seasonally adjusted 6.2 per cent in April, with 594,300 jobs lost during the month.
Just over 594,000 jobs were lost in April, which is more than the 550,000 jobs that economists expected. It was the biggest monthly fall in employment since records started being kept in 1978.
