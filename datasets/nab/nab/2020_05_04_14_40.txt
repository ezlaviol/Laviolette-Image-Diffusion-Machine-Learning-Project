2020-05-04T14:40:00+10:00 : why would anyone follow Buffetts advice right now? He had huge stakes in airlines which he sold (all at loss), BH has lost 60 billion (from memory) during Covid 19 and, no offence Warren, but he is in his mid nineties.... time’s up! he became one of the worlds best investors by listening to nobody but his own smart head. I don’t know about you, but I’m planning to do just that....
