2020-04-29T17:24:00+10:00 : It appears that people here couldn't be bothered reading the NAB statement. Details of the SPPNAB holders as at cob 24th April can apply for up to $30,000 worth.The Issue Price of SPP Shares will be the lower of:- A$14.15; and- the VWAP (volume weighted average price) on ASX during the five trading days up to, and including, the SPP closing date (expected to be Friday 22 May 2020) less a 2% discount, rounded down to the nearest cent. Make sure you understand what VWAP means...Depending on the level of demand, NAB may decide to scale back applications, or raise an amount higher than A$500 million. ...If a scale back is applied, it is NAB's intention that the scale back will be applied having regard to the pro rata shareholding of eligibleshareholders (as at 7.00pm on Friday, 24 April 2020) who apply for SPP Shares. However, NAB is not required to conduct a scale back in this way, and may scale back applications for SPP Shares in any manner and to any extent in its absolute discretion.That's it - It's simple and black and white:If NAB do not scale back then oversubscriptions will be accepted (I think this is likely to keep faith with retail holders) otherwise there are two ways they will scale back.  There is basically 35m shares being offered - I feel that the offer may close early and oversubscribed.AND - since the funds can trade their new shares from tomorrow then the price will likely drop tomorrow.
