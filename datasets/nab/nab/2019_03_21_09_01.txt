2019-03-21T09:01:00+11:00 : Being completely apolitical here - I have a SMSF - building up from a low level - and don't have that many years left in the workforce. I sort of miss out on these exclusions and it does seem strange to me that in a country worried about an aging population and the cost of aged pensions that this will be seen as a good idea. I won't help me or many others in the same position. Backdating the measure seems a bit ominous. That's my 2 cents anyway.However, life goes on and it is a hurdle to overcome

Need to get facts correct if posting. Very informative article by Monica Rule in last weekends Weekend Australian about Labors plans for dividend imputation tax refund policy. I urge all people concerned to read the article.Briefly.......... anyone on a full or part centrelink benefit as of 28th. March 2018 will retain franking credits. (Age Pensioners, Disability Pensioners, Unemployed, Carers etc etc.) ALSO if 1 member of a SMSF meets the aforesaid criteria the SMSF will receive franking credits.After some 6,000 posts only got 18 light bulbs. Says it all really. Lift your game.
