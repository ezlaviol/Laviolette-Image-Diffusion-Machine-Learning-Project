2020-05-07T10:06:00+10:00 : Am I missing something with this strategy.....I hold 1,000 shares today, if I sell today at say $16.50 and then apply for the full $30k in the SPP (with an assumption that I'm going to be scaled back), aren't I guaranteeing a $2+ plus better outcome on each share in my shareholding?
