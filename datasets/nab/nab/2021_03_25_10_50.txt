The higher-ups squeezing the lower downs. or cut them off. If things are not too rosy like the Business divisions. Mark my words, the Job keeper gone. more zombie businesses go under. that division not making as much money they will Shrink it. The Homeloans are doing well but margins are being squeezed too. look at the bonds if "they" can't contain the rates. It will squeeze into the margins for the banks. and with higher capital ratios I think the glory days are "limited" but I think it will run for another 1 year before it goes a bit pear shape. It's just a cruel game of life with the games they are playing. Just got to look past the poo and grab as much money from the market as possible.
