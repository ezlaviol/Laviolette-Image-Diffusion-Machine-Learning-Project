I think 2 years to +97% recovery would be great, if banks can hang in there around $19 to $20 for Nab and equivalent for the ANZ/WBC for next 2 years then investors look at current price and saw a bargin. IMO bank rally will slow now due to hardships for customers with mortgages biting into profits and dividends - of course the recovery may happen more quickly depends how we all spend over the next 6 months.
