As said above, and I agree, if the market doesnt like this ann. the S.P.P. issue price  may well be cheaper than the price suggested in the ann. 
 Ill leave it for you to work out why and how that may work. Not being patronising but better for you to understand all the gobblygook. Of course you can ask again if you cant find the answer.
