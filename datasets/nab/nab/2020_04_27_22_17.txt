2020-04-27T22:17:00+10:00 : Greedy banks you think with all the money they have they would not need a CR
But I think it’s time for me to buy a bank shares as they have dropped 50% or so and I’m with NAB so looking to enter 
Does anyone have any idea what price the CR will be. 
$100 k or so from super as I’m 40 I can hold 20 years if I have to
