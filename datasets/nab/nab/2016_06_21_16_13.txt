2016-06-21T16:13:00+10:00 : I agree that Aus election isnt exerting any pressure on markets, and that bookmakers see an LNP majority as a foregone conclusion.

IMO the odds misrepresent the situation, its a confidence game for the LNP, the last thing they want is to look chaotic or desperate, they dont want to remind people of their leadership problems, they want voters to think everything is under control, and this is going to be an orderly transition.

Another essential poll out today that has ALP at 51%. But I dont think the market will see a LNP loss coming, so plenty of time to wait until it happens. Wait for the hung parliament, the weeks of counting, the negotiating with cross-benches, the fear at the possibility of needing a new election (both major parties say they wont negotiate with cross benches). Looks like a lot of potential drama and uncertainty to me.

Nick Xenophon supports a banking enquiry, and he is likely to be the kingmaker in the event of a hung parliament.
