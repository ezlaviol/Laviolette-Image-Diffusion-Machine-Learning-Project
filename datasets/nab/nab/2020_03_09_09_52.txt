Ok I should with hindsight  have held back on the buying, but couldnt resist.    Still have a (very) little held back.I'm thinking with only Sydney ASX operating that I ought to wait and see what happens with DOW.    NAB could slip  further on Tuesday.  How much?   Depends on the stupidity of the sheep but my gut feel is that this cannot last much longer.
