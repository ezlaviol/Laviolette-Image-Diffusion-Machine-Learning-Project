2020-11-24T11:34:00+11:00 : UBank may be a success now , I have not looked into it in a while.However if you go back 3-5 years, UBank could only handle one product, which was a deposit product that paid a higher than market rate to entice customers.  UBank was supposed to be the catalyst for retirement of many, many, NAB systems and support a core overhaul.Did that ever happen?  The arrangement with Oracle on the UBank system and replacement of existing systems was an incredibly expensive exercise in stupidity, aided and abetted by the leadership at the time.Hopefully things have improved however my last discussion with NAB IT on a cloud migration (albeit a couple of years ago) was very underwhelming,
