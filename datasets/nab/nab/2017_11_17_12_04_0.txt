Apparently information on borrowers was given by third parties for these loans.

The scandal surrounds the bankâ€™s so-called Introducer Program. Under that program, NAB pays commissions to businesses, such as financial planning and real estate agencies, that refer customers who then take out a mortgage.
The information provided for the loan-approval process often came from the third-party referrers rather than the customers, Business Daily believes.
Many of the loans in question are believed have been given to overseas investors who bought property in the red-hot Victorian and New South Wales housing markets.
