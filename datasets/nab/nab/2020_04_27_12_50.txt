2020-04-27T12:50:00+10:00 : first of all you haven’t factored in dividends. Which is what performance measurement will use.secondly you’re cherry picking a stat where banks across the entire globe have fallen 40% in a month due to a once in a 100 year pandemic. Banks have never fallen so violently...the rebound might also be quite swift as history shows.third, NAB has been a poor investment in general compared to other big 4 banks. Not discounting that. But I own all the banks.fourth, diversify, you won’t get everything right, and if you say you do, then you’re full of it. This is one of 40 odd stocks I own on top of index funds.
