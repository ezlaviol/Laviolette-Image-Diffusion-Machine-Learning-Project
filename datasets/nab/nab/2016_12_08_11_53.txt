2016-12-08T11:53:00+11:00 : Banks surged higher together today which I'd say is related to the surge in the US overnight (DJIA up 300).

Looking at Comsec, banks dominate the most popular stocks sells today.
I reckon NAB will still go higher and is well positioned amongst the banks.

I sold a small parcel at $29 a couple of weeks ago to take some profits (and cause I had to replace a car), they were shares I'd bought at $24.10 earlier in the year. Still holding a fair bit and confident in NAB medium to long term.
