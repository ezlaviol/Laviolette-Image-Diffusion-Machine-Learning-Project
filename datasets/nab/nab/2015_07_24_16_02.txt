2015-07-24T16:02:00+10:00 : NAB are a bloody joke.

When I invested in NAB about 12 years ago their SP was about $27 and the other 3 of the 4 major banks were way behind with CBA approx $8 -$10 less than NAB and ANZ and Westpac were languishing a long way behind.

Nowadays CBA is leaps and bounds ahead at $88 and WBC has a stronger SP than us with ANZ clapping at our heels also.

Absolutely a disgraceful performance over a 12 year period of time.

Heads need to roll and get this bank back on the band wagon.
