2020-08-10T21:53:00+10:00 : Geez poppypop - what are you saying here? Everyone who is getting assistance because their employers were forced to let them go because of COVID-19 is a "dole bludger" and it is going to be OK because anyone who hits 60 is going to die and make it easier for everyone else?That is not only warped thinking but somewhat flawed. Those dole bludgers you look down on are the ones spending and holding the economy up at the moment - and those expendable retirees represent the "demand side" of the economy - when they go, it will make it harder for the economy to recover.Probably timely to let you know that those terrible retirees hold the majority of retail bank shares - and their super funds hold most of what is left. Bet you they loved your post.Don't know who you are but I have developed a mental picture of you.

I see huge upside wether virus disappears or not, people start working either way with masks and gloves, no more dole bludger hand outs as obligations willhave to be met. retirees will mostly die and leave large inheritances and stop taking the pension. the economy will boom either way.
