2020-09-04T13:16:00+10:00 : I bought in to NAB first time during the March crash at 15.00. And bought more over the last 6 months. (I had been sitting watching and waiting in the lead up)Must also mention the dividend I recieved and my play with CFDs all of which I put back in.I am sitting at an average price of $17 with a view to hold long term.Profit to date up at 55.7% and long term passive income to follow.NAB has proven to be a nice addition to my portfolio. All built on doom and gloom.I am still bullish on this long term and will be acquiring more.
