2018-11-16T13:16:00+11:00 : It has already been published a large number of times from various sources (Motley Fool & Morgan Stanley to name a few), NAB will be highly likely to cut dividend. IMO its not a case of if, but rather a case of when. I think some of the larger holders are already packing up until they see the price settle. As stated by a few others on the forum all other banks up and NAB down, why? Because some holders want to see NAB next divy announcement before buying back in.
