However this is what happens when housing becomes more expensive than the country is willing to pay its workers to afford. I suspect a lot of citizens will be heading for the exit when the cost of a roof to sleep under exceeds the workers ability to pay for it. The amount of homeless people is already at alarming levels. Pretty amazing really for such a large country with such a small population.
