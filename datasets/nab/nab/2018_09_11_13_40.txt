2018-09-11T13:40:00+10:00 : Good PR move when banks are being crucified. Costing them $15mil a month according 9 news last night.

I don't know how sustainable it is but I guess it'll bring in new customers & see existing loans transferred to NAB.

SP dipped this morning but seems to be bouncing back a little now $27.745...

I'd still love to see a RC into Federal politicians and their perks/practices.
