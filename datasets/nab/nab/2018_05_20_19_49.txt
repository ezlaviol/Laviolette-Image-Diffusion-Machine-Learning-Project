I agree CSL is a quality stock and created amazing value for shareholders. We use dividends to reinvest across various sectors, so even CSL as good as it’s been isn’t great. Unfranked and low dividend which means ill lose 30% +\- whatever structure I buy it in. Rather buy something like Pfizer to be honest. 

However REA, eppp we are semi involved in real estate, I can’t see how that stock will perpetually rise as it is. It’s market cap is worth more than the entire agent’s businesses it markets (its very customers!) across all of Australia. A future FXJ IMO and I’d argue they will eventually price themselves out to a new future advertising medium. My opinion of course, and again I’m large cap mature (blue chips) only. I won’t pay $10bn plus for 30-50 PE stocks.
