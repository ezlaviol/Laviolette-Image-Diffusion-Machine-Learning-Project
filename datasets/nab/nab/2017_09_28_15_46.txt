2017-09-28T15:46:00+10:00 : With the record date coming up for the Final Dividend on the 10th November I guess we'll see a steady tick up on the share price between now & then.

Seems to be pretty steady around the $31.30/$31.40 range at the moment. 

Any TA people out there that could post a chart? Thanks in advance....
