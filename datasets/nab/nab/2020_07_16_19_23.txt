2020-07-16T19:23:00+10:00 : With all the barricades, Border Walls, Police shooting dead men in Victoria, and all the other unconstitutional chaos in what remains of Australia, I am surprised the Federal Government and State Governments are doing anything productive or doing any “productivity reforms”.NAB has a problem in that it is in a country completely in chaos due to Government Border “barricades” a.k.a. Border Walls, corruption enquiries one after the other, and massive unemployment and under employment.Australia is nearing an end R.I.P. Perhaps it will go back to the 19th Century when NSW and Victoria powered the continent and the areas outside Sydney and Melbourne were full of outlaws and convicted felons.
