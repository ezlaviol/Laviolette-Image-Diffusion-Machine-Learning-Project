Most investors would have some sort of TAX to offset and the Funds won't have a problem, that leaves the mums and dads mostly. Then there are those that have at least one (of a couple) in part pension before 31st Mar 18; they are exempt. I am lucky to be in that situation.

I am just wondering exactly how many will be affected even if they got it passed. I suspect that there will be a lot more independents just like "Wentworth" to stop that sort of thing.
