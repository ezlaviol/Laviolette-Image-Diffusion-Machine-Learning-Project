You say that NAB dividend yield is 9%. They paid out 83 cents in May and likely to be same in November. Therefore the yield will be 6%, unless you are adding on the franking credit which, for true yield purposes, only applies to SMSF in pension mode where lucky punters get the credit refunded by ATO.
