2019-12-29T17:42:00+11:00 : In November I was speaking to a lady in SA who works for ANZ in a country branch.She said they now have only one client who puts cash in and takes cash out via a teller and refuses a card of any sort (very eccentric, apparently) and therefore won't use an autoteller either. Everyone else has a card and uses the autoteller except for 2, who prefer to bank with a person, but have cards and will take out cash from the machine if they need to.So I guess the writing's on the wall there. For that branch, anyway. I can't see it continuing to operate for very much longer.Wonder what happens to the odd guy?A bit like my sister...she still transfers money by cheque (!) LOL
