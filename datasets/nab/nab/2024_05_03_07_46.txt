All the banks had a reasonable day yesterday even Westpac went up.Have a look at what CbrMaroon posted, that part of the report which could not be fudged made “technology and compliance” the key issue for NAB.NAB is a high risk stock IMHO. The buyback makes it more risky as NAB could be buying back at top of market.
