2016-08-16T18:17:00+10:00 : At the risk of going off topic, look at what happened to BEN a few weeks before the div run. Trading low $9. Look at it now. Ex on 6th Sept and not only beating BoQ which pays a higher yield but on days like today a 3c drop. And BoQ? Getting played hard with 20 days until results then another 20 days to buy before ex. 9th sept is the last day to buy BoQ to qualify under the 47 day tax rule to claim franked divs so I'm expecting much playing of the sp before it comes to the 16th sep for NAB to qualify for franked divs. Should have bought PLS today myself! And MOY  sheesh what did I say about that the other day.

Anyway. I'm almost excited to see what happens to CBA tomorrow 


On topic.. NAB will get some serious massage before ex ATO rule by traders that have no interest in franked divs. I'm hoping its in the $25's. If it's the $24's then shut up and TAKE MY MONEY
