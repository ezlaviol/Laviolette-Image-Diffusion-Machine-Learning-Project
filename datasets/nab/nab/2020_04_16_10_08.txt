2020-04-16T10:08:00+10:00 : All the indications are that the dividend will be reduced - and that makes a lot of sense. Particularly as it is a percentage of profits which will have taken a hit.  Also, pressure from the reserve bank who have requested that banks retain as much capital as possible - also makes sense.What has also been indicated is that dividends will still be paid by Australian banks and not stopped as elsewhere in the world.Total guess but I am factoring in a dividend of 50 cents in July.

yeah I did hear this.  Was wandering if they give an indication of the rate (i.e: 83c) prior to the ex-div-date?
