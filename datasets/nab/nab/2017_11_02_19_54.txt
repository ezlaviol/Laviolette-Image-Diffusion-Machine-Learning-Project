2017-11-02T19:54:00+11:00 : Ah yes. I remember buying in 25s during 2008. SP fell another $10 in less than a year. But ended up being a great investment, bought some more at $21.50 with the equity raising and held on for years of DRP. Memories....

Anyway, looking forward I still think NAB will do OK. 

Even without growth, as mentioned it makes sense as a yield play in this low rate environment. 1.5% in the bank or 6% ff dividend, not much of a choice - unless the property market actually does crash. Given up waiting for that...
