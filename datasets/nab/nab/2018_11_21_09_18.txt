2018-11-21T09:18:00+11:00 : Overnight markets were somewhat on the weak side again making this space a little bit harder. You get that.  Credit spreads are widening by a wide margin and are now overcooked to the downside although there's plenty of room to widen more.  Financials were weak overnight and that will no doubt flow through to the financials here today. Might be a trying day right from the get go.
