2020-01-06T23:22:00+11:00 : My trading technical analysis indicates a Hammer chart pattern has formed on NAB which is an extremely bullish signal indicating NAB's SP may rise from the close of $24.55 (AUD). A Hammer appears during NAB's downtrend, displaying a long lower shadow with a small real body at the top of the range. NAB's SP may be developing a bottom and due for a reversal to the upside.This bullish pattern is best analysed using a technical chart.
