2020-08-24T23:53:00+10:00 : Non bank lenders are chipping away at mortgages at increasing levels, helped in large part by politicians who are actively encouraging consumers to shop around for a better deal (gotta prop up the RE market at all cost). BNPL schemes are eroding credit card profits, unemploymemt and bad debts are rising and record low interest rates and wage stagnation are here to stay for the foreseeable future.The Australian banks are unlikely to ever be the dividend darlings they once were and the share prices are starting to reflect this reality. In fact, it's possible, or even likely, that there will be further bank CR's in future, which will just serve to drive dividends and the share price down even further. The only way the big banks can stay moderately profitable is to keep closing branches, slash more staff, reduce dividends while trying to maintain high CC interest rates and charges, which of course will only drive more consumers away from them. I wouldn't really say any of the big four are 'safe havens' any more. We are in a new paradigm. What was once, is no more!
