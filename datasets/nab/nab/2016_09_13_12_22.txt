2016-09-13T12:22:00+10:00 : Does anybody have any idea how the implementation of the core banking system is going at nab?

Banks have not been good at delivering these big projects and nab in particular have written off hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of not being able to delivery a usable system.  

Do we need to factor in a big write-down again?
