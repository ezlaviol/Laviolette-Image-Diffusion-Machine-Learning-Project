2016-02-01T10:06:00+11:00 : SYDNEY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's Investors  Service said on Monday it expects credit costs to increase  "moderately" for Australian banks as a deep downturn in the  resources sector aggravates macroeconomic risks.  	Moody's said regions and sectors most exposed to mining are  starting to see some signs of stress and while Australian banks'  direct exposure to the resources sector was relatively low, they  faced "high second-order risks".  	Australia's super profitable major banks currently have very  low levels of stressed loans in their portfolio. They came out  of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed but now face  higher regulatory capital and a slowdown in the broader economy.
