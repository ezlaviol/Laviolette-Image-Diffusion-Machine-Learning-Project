Footmax ,Franking is 42% of the dividends paid.Let me explain this . Company pays 100 cents dividend which is taxed at 30% so shareholder then gets 70 cents franked.This tax is then returned to shareholder if not earning or super fund .i.e. 30 cents on 70 cents dividend which is 42.6% return .That help.
