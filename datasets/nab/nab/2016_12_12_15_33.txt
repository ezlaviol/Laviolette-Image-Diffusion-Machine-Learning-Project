2016-12-12T15:33:00+11:00 : can someone explain to me why NAB can go down the register almost 5% before putting in a change in substantial notice? everyone else has to do it for every 1% they change. there hasn't been enough volume in the stock such that it could have been over a day or two, this must have been sustained selling. 

is this much ado about nothing or are they holding back substantials to keep their position shielded from public view?
