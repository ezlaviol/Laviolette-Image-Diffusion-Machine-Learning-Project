My basic thinking is it's reasonably big, last financial report was ok, have not heard anything bad in the media or anywhere else, dividend is good,  trading at lower range of 52 week low. Should therefore be due for a run soon. I don't have an in depth analysis though. 

I personally don't envisage I will hold it for more than a few months, but that is just me and I am not saying you should not. If you don't plan on holding it for a long time,  market sentiment is probably more important than FA, as long as it does not fall over while you are on board. 

Good luck.
