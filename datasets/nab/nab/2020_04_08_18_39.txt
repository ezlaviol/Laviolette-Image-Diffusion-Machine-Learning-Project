2020-04-08T18:39:00+10:00 : NAB doesn't have to raise Capital as we have a CET1 of around 10.38% for market conditions like this, so APRA will relax the CET1.The first half results are to the end of March which would hardly be effected by the Chinese Flu.I expect a greatly reduced dividend to cover projected losses for the second half FY results.Remember last RBA interest rate cut wasn't passed onto house lending.Question, how many of people who lost their jobs are renters compared to home owners?Remember the banks have put on hold loan repayments for people affected reducing bank repossessions.Remember this has only been going for 8 weeks.I think people are overreacting and the banks are a better investment compared to a Oil stock and Qantas. Bank profits have reduces but bad debt won't be as bad as people are making out to be.Final note, I can see government slowly relaxing business restrictions next month and this will further reduce banking profits.Remember scaremongering is easy and facts take time.
