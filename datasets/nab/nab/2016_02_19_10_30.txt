2016-02-19T10:30:00+11:00 : (Adds analyst comment, industry context)  	National Australia Bank  (NAB) ,  the country's No.1 lender, on Friday announced the surprise  resignation of chief financial officer Craig Drummond after just  2-1/2 years in the role.  	Drummond's exit, viewed by analysts as a major loss for NAB,   has sparked speculation that he could be headed to rival ANZ  Banking Group  (ANZ)  where the CFO position is vacant.   	Earlier this week, new ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott said the bank  would announce a new CFO in the coming weeks. An ANZ spokesman  declined to comment on Friday.  	NAB did not reveal Drummond's future plans and a spokeswoman  could not immediately be reached for comment.  	"Drummond has done a lot of work there (at NAB). He has a  great reputation. It's a shame that NAB will lose him," Bell  Potter analyst TS Lim said.   	Drummond played a key role in helping NAB exit its  underperforming assets in the United States and Britain, while  also leading a A$5.5 billion ($3.9 billion) capital raising last  year.  	NAB CEO Andrew Thorburn said Drummond's resignation was a  "disappointment".   	"During Craig's tenure NAB has been through a period of  significant change, and Craig has been pivotal to this," he said  in a statement.  	With ANZ due for a transformation under Elliott, some  analysts said Drummond would be a good fit for the Asia-focused  lender as it tries to concentrate on the mortgage market at home  where growth is faster and returns attractive.		NAB promoted Gary Lennon, executive general manager finance,  to replace Drummond as chief financial officer. Lennon will  commence in the new role on March 15, which will also be  Drummond's final day at NAB.  ($1 = 1.3986 Australian dollars)
