We have around 30 holdings on the ASX plus some international index funds.Ill use dividends from booming sectors ie WES, WOW, COL, BHP, RIO, AMC etc to buy up distressed sectors like banking, gambling and insurance. I value invest my dividends. Admittedly I have almost no healthcare exposure. I may diversify into US mega cap pharma and healthcare though as Australia is just second tier.
