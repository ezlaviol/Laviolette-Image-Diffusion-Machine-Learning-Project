2020-05-04T19:20:00+10:00 : Approx a 1/3 of what you asked for was provided as per this posting:http://www.enoughwealth.com/2009/09/nab-spp-scale-back-refund-cheque.htmlOut of the $15,000 you could apply for at the time, this person allegedly received $4,343 worth of allotted shares to him/her.I don't know the author, it was a google search as I was looking for the same info on exactly how much was provided during the 2009 NAB SPP scaling back.DYOR but may shed some light on the scaling back of an over subscribed SPP,I'm in this for the long haul. So while the share price is under $20 i'm just accumulating. I appreciate every ones comments on here whether to sell/buy.
