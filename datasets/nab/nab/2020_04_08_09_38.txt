2020-04-08T09:38:00+10:00 : I have had some issues with slowness a couple of times over past few weeks, but volumes were certainly causing issues for all platforms. (NAB's advice to ensure log in prior to opening seemed to work quite well at that time)
Have seen many complaints (over time) about crashing at other on line brokers and I think from those reports Nabtrade is pretty good.............
