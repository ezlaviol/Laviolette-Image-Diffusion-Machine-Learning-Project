2016-03-07T19:14:00+11:00 : Hi all - new to NAB forum and here's my take. I sold out of all banks late last year with all the doom and gloom sentiment and fearful sentiment over the tightening of regs. Suddenly banks were 'on the nose'. And prices went ridiculously low. 

 I bought NAB last week and have had a nice rise.

Why did I buy? Regulation of banks got us through the GFC. The new regulations ultimately strengthen our banks. Our banks are reputable on the whole. There has been a lot of media noise about exposure to China etc. And now NAB is as cheap as chips. What's not to like?
