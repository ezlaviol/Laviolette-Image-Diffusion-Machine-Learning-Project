2018-06-06T11:53:00+10:00 : While I prefer to do my own thinking, the analysts who work for the brokers have better technical skills, have access to better resources and are doing this as a full  time job. So while I would never blindly follow anyone's recommendations, I do find their reports helpful both in terms of providing ideas and for checking against my own. I have plenty of examples from my own investments where brokers' reports have made me money (CGF at below $3.00) and plenty where I would have done better to ignore them (several small mining stocks).

And, yes they get it very wrong often enough to make me intensely skeptical about the whole process â€“ I'm old enough to remember all the "buy" recommendations on companies like Adsteam, Bell Resources, Bond Corp, Rothwells and Qintex (among others).  But there are also people like Derik Terrington and Terry Smith whose calls as analysts cost them their jobs even though they were proved right.

As for the headlines, the brokers don't usually write these - they come from media hacks trying to attract attention. "Price target cut by X% - time to panic" makes for better click bait than "Dividends forecast to be steady - please return to your afternoon nap."

At the end of the day, brokers' reports are just one input into my decision making process.
