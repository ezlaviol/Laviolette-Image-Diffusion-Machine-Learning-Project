2020-03-27T22:10:00+11:00 : Bear trap. More concerning is the real economic damage done to the populations worldwide.This is only the beginnings, read about history. 1939 crash was only the start, then substantial bear trap and 1930 double and depression.Some will argue the world is more sophisticated in 2020, maybe but governments are now going to blow their resources beyond their capacity and some countries will go bankrupt.In some countries people will put to power strong headed politicians, in fact dictators in disguise.You donâ€™t need much one country to crack and invade another for resources to survive, This looks more and more a 1940 scenario for 2028 future.NAB at $8 seems expensive but a vaccine by June would save many lives in the coming years, current SP is irrelevant now.
