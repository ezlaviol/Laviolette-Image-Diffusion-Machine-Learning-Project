Nab stretched itself to maintain, and wbc had a slight increase. If cba cuts, I agree that the market is likely to get upset, and probably also affect nab. My impression is that cba is least likely to cut out of the big four, so I am curious why you are so confident to risk eating cake on this? 

I also think what happens next week with the rba will have significant impact. Many are predicting a cut, which if it comes I think will push the banks along, but if it doesn't there may be a retrace depending on how much Mrs. Market has already priced the cut in. I think if the planets align and rba cuts, and cba doesn't 80 or near enough is achievable and you will be eating mudcake  and I will be . Not sure what I will do then.

If the sp wanders around where it is now going up to div, I will probably just hold and concentrate my attention on the others, God knows some (really just one) of them needed it. Knowing what to do, like letting go, is different  to doing it, and sometimes I am as stubborn as a mule . I think I am way too close to that one and am blinded by this. 

Regarding the cake, I was thinking photo evidence from the loser, of the cake with the winners name graffitied in the icing ?
