2017-01-03T14:01:00+11:00 : NAB continues trading strongly today, so I thought a new thread was in order. A natural extension of this thread
$30 soon? now that NAB is trading over $31.

I see Motley Fool have recently started suggesting the banks could be a buy and they provide 3 key reasons with Big Dividends, Modest Growth and Tail Winds.

I also see an exciting development in partnership with REA which I was surprised not to see in the NAB sub-forum?

"NAB Chief Operating Officer, Antony Cahill, said the partnership will bring property search and home lending together in a way thatâ€™s never been seen before."

Looks to me like they are innovating within their core business.
