Ok tks. I did go to the ASX before posting but in my haste I didn't read yesterdays announcements as far down as I should.

So it is for this latest Insto offering and they will notify the ASX when ready. Strange Ive seen many stocks have offerings without a trading halt. Is their perhaps and associated reason for this halt.
