2020-03-14T13:19:00+11:00 : ..... Anybody jumping to buy on Monday needs a chill pill or have no learnt any lesson from last 4 cycles of Rally and Crash during last few weeks......Last four weeks all market rally ended in disaster with very next day crash at much lower price than last closing price...Simple Question - Why should market rally at closing time ? Because INSTO wants to dump their parcel next day what they bought earlier day at throw away price. ..15% over night gain is massive gain. I don't know a single person who will not sell at 15% Profit in two days. People dont make 15% in a year....
