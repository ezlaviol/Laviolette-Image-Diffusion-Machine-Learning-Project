2020-07-21T17:04:00+10:00 : Well I bought at 15.00 in May, then more at 16.00I will be a long way to we get back to pre-covid rates. I am hanging on till August / September or till we receive a Annual report before buying more. I do not think its going to be pretty. We all know why. I am in this for the long run, so a small loss now is not big for me.
