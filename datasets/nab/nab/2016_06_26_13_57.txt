2016-06-26T13:57:00+10:00 : Super, just adding my 2 cents worth. Your comment that NAB reacted by falling a dollar, due to the Brexit result, was like NAB was the worst performer across the market and across the sector. Not much was spared on Friday, QBE was down 8% at one stage. 

Imo DJIA was an orderly sell off, plus there were some index rebalancing taking place, suggests it's not all Brexit.

The Brits have two years to get their house in order, before the divorce is done and dusted.

Now watch for the rumors that Germany and France will offer concessions to stay in the Union. Or a mooted second referendum may be called with a higher hurdle rate for the yes / no vote. 

The next two years will be a hedge fund delight.
