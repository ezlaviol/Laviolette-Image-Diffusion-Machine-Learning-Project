2019-12-30T16:26:00+11:00 : CBA is an old styled public savings bank, Netbank goes down alot, the ASB portal in NZ is pathetic. NAB has too many retail branches, BNZ still has too many branches full of nothing but bankers doing God knows and not enough governance. ANZ and Westpac appear to be the most digitally able. They do not appear to have too many branches, seem efficient, perhaps too efficient given their scandals and governance problems, perhaps they need more people not lessNAB is still undervalued under $25 AUD IMHO, CBA is massively overpriced for what it is, ANZ and Westpac massively undervalued although WBC had a good day.
