2018-01-20T15:58:00+11:00 : You say you need to get rid of your NAB shares? Is that because of financial difficulties or you see a better investment? If you have discretion here, better to continue holding long term. The next few weeks or months donâ€™t matter. You are getting a high fully franked dividend and selling now would no doubt realise a loss. NAB is a better positioned bank to weather any residential downturn, and most analysts see fair value well north of $34.

So unless your forced to sell, hold on and even pick up stock if it falls below $29. I intend to do so.....DYOR
