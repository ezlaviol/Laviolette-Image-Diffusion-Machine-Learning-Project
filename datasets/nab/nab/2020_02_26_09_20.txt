2020-02-26T09:20:00+11:00 : I've had this theory about the next dividend, since NAB announced that the most recent HY result was similar to the same HY last year.  Last year they were parking upwards of $500 Million to cover expected Royal Commission costs, which they don't have to do this time (as far as we know).  On that basis I'm thinking that there might be scope to increase the dividend amount, might not get to 99c, but a bit of upward trend would look very good for sentiment.Any thoughts?  preferably with some basis.
