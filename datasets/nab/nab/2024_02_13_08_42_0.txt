Ground hog day, ie one insider banker handing over to yet another handpicked (by the outgoing CEO) insider banker, originally from Canada?  As a NAB holder, hoping the new CEO designate is not purported to be the NAB equivalent to the WBC Peter King appointment as the next generation of banking sector reformists. Promised the world of reform, compliance and performance, the actual so far, more scandals, ASIC fines, underperformance, more like an atlas than anything else.
