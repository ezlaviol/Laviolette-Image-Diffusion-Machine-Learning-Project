2018-11-20T09:17:00+11:00 : The day might not be that bad as the credit markets and the financial sector out performed the broader markets by a long shot overnight. Should probably expect weakness on the opening here but might well see strength into early afternoon at least. First target is 23.46-23.44 Another one at 23.19 on the hourly chart.
