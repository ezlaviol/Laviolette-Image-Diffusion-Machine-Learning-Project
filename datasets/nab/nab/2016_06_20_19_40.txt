2016-06-20T19:40:00+10:00 : I sort of agree Nanood- like I said, too much logic in my earlier post. 

My gut tells me the way things are going we will get a bounce over the pre Brexpanic but it will be well priced in by the ASX close Thursday. Buy the rumour etc.

There may still be a bounce on Friday but it'll probably be in proportion to the sorts of odds the bookies have on Thursday. I mean, if the odds are like tonight at 1.30 maybe a small bounce, at 1.60 a handy bounce but at 1.10 hardly any bounce.

I also think Friday sometime may be a good chance for the shorters.

Of course, if the mood is as it is tonight and we get a Leave vote, wow! I bet we'd see a fourth standard deviation, I.e. a movement supposedly seen once every two years, (three every four years actually).

Oh $hit, too much (attempted) logic again.

By the way JCoure, your bullishness tonight is good to see!
