2019-12-13T21:59:00+11:00 : The persistent very low interest environment puts a major squeeze on Bank margins....that is a fact. So the Banks have to find other ways to turn a dollar: lowering their fixed costs is the obvious place to start. Expect a lot more branch closures and middle management job losses. The Banks are also facing a major challenge from smaller nimble players. Some new Banks....MONZO for example do not even have a physical central office which is open to their customers. Walk around London and every second person under 30 seems to be using a bright orange MONZO card. It is difficult to see much growth in Banks, though they should continue to pay (much more modest) dividends. (my position in NAB is speculative only)
