2020-05-29T09:28:00+10:00 : bad timing to try and work out the market atmo with the volatility.  It is purely sentiment on any given day/week and there is actually no sense to be made of it.  EXCEPT that powers greater than you and I are the influencers of the large cap stocks. If yo are looking to buy blue chips for the long term then do a bit of research and start buying what you believe will do well in the long term.  To assist the buy in, maybe set a program to take a bite each week/month for the next 6 months to get a better average buy in price.
