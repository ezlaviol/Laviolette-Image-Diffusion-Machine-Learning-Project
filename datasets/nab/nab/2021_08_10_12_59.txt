2021-08-10T12:59:00+10:00 : I invested in NAB just over a week ago and BEN and im up almost $500 bucks on the pair from relatively small investments.Banks have been around since donkeys years. Even if the market collapses, they will still be here long after the market bounces back. An if you dont need the money in the short to medium term whats the issue if the market does have a correction?Its easy to bag out a stock or not be happy with a short term perspective. I look long term and NAB will be one hell of a stock!DONT SAY I DIDNT WARN YOU!
