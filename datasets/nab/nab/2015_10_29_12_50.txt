Why do you think an old hat article from 2010 by an academic has any relevance to today's NAB. They seem on the mend to me, leading to a brighter future in mid 2016. Divs are better than most, especially in SMSF. I'm amazed at sellers so close to record date. Anyway, excellent buying for those arithmetically inclined,
Cheers, Japes.
