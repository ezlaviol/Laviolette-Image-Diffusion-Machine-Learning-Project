2020-03-06T10:31:00+11:00 : the bottom line is dividend still valid at this level or slightly lower? if that is the case, i am happy to hold it for 9% gross dividend, where savings rate has dropped to sub 2% now. the worst thing is there is something we don't know about the bank in specific as drop is not compatible with the general market crash.
