2015-10-29T22:40:00+11:00 : FWIW there is a gap at 29.92 (Sept 30 high). As previously mentioned the ex div date is a week away so that gap might be looked as an entry for a lot of traders should it hit in the next day or two. The recent lows speak for themselves and the same traders who play the div will have stops circling those lows. The long term trend is not in danger but can be seen creeping up on the chart.
