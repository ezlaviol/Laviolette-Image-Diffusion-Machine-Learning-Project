2017-11-03T11:50:00+11:00 : R u trying to replicate the market? IMHO I understand why an exchange traded fund or human trying to replicate such a fund would buy it but have no clue why a human would select it based on the info at this time.

The update basically came up with the strategy that NAB will move to tech but IMHO no strategy on what and how? Do they understand the governance, risk and compliance of such a strategy? 

What is the unknown? Other than just cost cuts? How is NAB different from BEN beyond being bigger? I do not get it and IMHO seems like the market does not get it either. 

Why would a human hold NAB? IMHO but pls DYOR that bec9mes a question after the trading update?
