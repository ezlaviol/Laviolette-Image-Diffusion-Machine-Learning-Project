So the US shutting all travel may be like shutting the gates long after the horse bolted. The curve from the infected could still be there but just delayed or it could all just disappear like sars did. Actually sars I think was way worse off memory and the markets hardly blinked. I suspect this whole reversal is more media led than reality but everyone has their opinions.
