2018-05-30T09:18:00+10:00 : they won't cut it this year, but dividends from 2019 will depend on how their restructuring and fintech plans are shaping up, Nab is more reliant on general business conditions than the other banks, assuming that their plans are on track, and that the Aus economy doesn't stagnate or go backwards (that depends a lot on China), then I think they won't cut their dividend, they might even crack $2 if their strategy works out, it's a bit of a gamble, they will be investing billions in the next two years, so place your bets
