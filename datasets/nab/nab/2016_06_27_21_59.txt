2016-06-27T21:59:00+10:00 : It would appear that the politicians leading brexit are back-pedalling on their promises already, if you can believe CNN (http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/27/news/economy/brexit-broken-promises/index.html). 
It must be hard to understand why there suddenly is not the pot of gold at the end of brexit that was promised. I think protection of their borders (which I can understand) especially with so many of them living in mainland Europe will be difficult to enforce without inconveniencing themselves. By the time they figure out what a pain in the behind this is going to be and how much effort it will take to execute, particularly if the countries in mainland Europe become uncooperative, I wonder if they ask to be let back in. Now that would make interesting trading circumstances. Anyway it's their decision. Good luck to them. They have survived worst.
In January RBS made the news when they said sell everything. At least they can say they were correct. Their SP has fallen by 35% in two days (they are copping it tonight).
On a more serious note, Red is everywhere. FTSE is down, US futures are down, our futures are down, the U.K. Banks are really down (surely they must be really cheap by now). That makes me think we are getting another touch up, if not beating, tomorrow. 
Good luck to all looking to buy low, but I don't think you will need it.
In the long term I don't think this will matter to us too much, unless negative sentiment begins to snowball around the world. I don't think the attention span of the market is longer than a few weeks, at most.
