2015-06-06T19:21:00+10:00 : stackey-banks are about 15% below what they should be.
you have CBA going exdiv. in august,and at sp $80,it equates to 5.2%FF.
with NAB,even with the slight dilution,the sp is absurdly low.
even regionals like BOQ,are at 12/1 PE,and 5.8% divvy.

everybody seems to worry about this so called housing bubble. if interest rates ever go up,there will be no crash as such anyway .most of the risk  is held by investors. it is not like the ponzi scheme that created the GFC  in the US.
i just can't believe that people are hoodwinked into this nonsensical type of hysteria.
i myself am going in with 20% portfolio weighting next week
