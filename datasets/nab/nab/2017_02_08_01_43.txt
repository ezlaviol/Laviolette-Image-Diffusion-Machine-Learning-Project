For example at SP $30.00 the current $1.98 divvy yields 6.6% gross but if the divvy gets reduced to (say) $1.90 that reduces to around 6.3% a divvy of $1.80 yields 6.0% so by comparison the NAB yield is still very good even if the divvy is reduced to $1.80.

This could be a good buying opportunity for anyone LT looking for yield especially if the price were to drift sub $30.
