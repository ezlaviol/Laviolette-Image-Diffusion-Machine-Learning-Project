2018-08-15T15:47:00+10:00 : I would like to bring readers' attention here to the following two statements extracted from the above article :-

1) Australia's No. 4 lender by market value posted cash earnings of A$1.65 billion ($1.20 billion) for the three months ended June 30, compared with A$1.7 billion last year.

2) Last week Australiaâ€™s biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , posted its first annual profit drop in close to a decade.

How many percent was CBA's drop,... anybody knows pls ?
