Based on the $3000 credit limit, we should compound the $20 monthly fee to get an equivalent to what the (effective) interest rate is.What credit checks would NAB run if any to minimise the risk of bad debts from consumers wiith no or a very poor credit rating?Clearly aimed at young adults 18-30.  I assume it'll be heavily promoted via influencers and social media like Instagram/Facebook.
