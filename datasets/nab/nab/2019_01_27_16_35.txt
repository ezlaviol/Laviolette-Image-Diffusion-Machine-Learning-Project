Waiting on fall out of RC findings etc etc. Paper talk of blow out in compensation to $1B + does not enthrall either. Companies paying out FF divs this half says they think the election result is done & dusted. Will need to have a knee jerk correction under $24 to get me in for a buffer.Meantime back at the ranch........................Gold has my interest. Good hedge in times of uncertainty. (GOR) Do some research.
