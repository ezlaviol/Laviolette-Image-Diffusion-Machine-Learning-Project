Lets suppose nab cut the div by 10% to 90c and the market reacts taking the price to $22. That still gives a gross div yield of 11.7%. Lets say they cut to 80c and sp falls to $20 that gives 11.4%. 

In early 2009 at the depths of the gfc, they cut div 25% from 97c to 73c. So if we take 25% as worst case scenario cut in fy17 then that gives 74c. Lets suppose the market reacts savagely and drops the price to $20. That still gives a gross div yield of 10.6%.

If they reduce div, the sp decline will start to stablise as uncertainty will have been reduced. If we end up with a royal commission, yes the initial reaction will be bad, but that uncertainty will be removed and the price will stabilise. 

Finance theory states that when div yields are high, subsequent future returns are also high. Likewise when div yields are low, future returns are low. So if we look to a year ago when the sp was $36 and the gross div yield was at a low of 7.9%, the subsequent returns have been low in line with finance theory. We now have very high div yields, so future returns should be high.

So in a nutshell, i am less worried when div yields are high as they are now. At $36 was the time to be worried.
