The fact is our lock down is far less strict than many (although I think the Vic Gov have gone a bit further!) Early on many Europeans were urging very strict lock downs with the theory that it would be short and sharp. Of course history has shown us that is all BS and many countries have been left in a sorry state with high death counts and having to extend or reimpose lockdowns.
Someone mentioned Sweden earlier. Unfortunately herd immunity won't be very effective until we have a vaccine and their death toll (per capita basis) is getting right up there so what price freedom.
Not sure we would have been happy with the prospect of an uncontrollable death toll and politicians will have to answer for their actions later.
At the moment we can be thankful for our position (on the pure basis of lives first) and hope it remains that way, but of course hindsight always creates all sorts of experts.....................
