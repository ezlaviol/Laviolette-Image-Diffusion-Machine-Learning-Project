2016-03-31T11:28:00+11:00 : Can someone please tell me if i brought shares around $23.00 and then lets say over a month the shares now cost $28.00 to buy, if i buy in again at $28.00 dose that lower the my all-round purchase price  that is $23.00, or will it bump it up because im paying $5.00 more a share.  

 To some of you it's probably a dumb question but it's a question I need answered as I'm not sure how it works.  

 Thank you in advance   

Regards
Darren
