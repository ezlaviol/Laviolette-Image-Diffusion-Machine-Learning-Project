2020-04-02T17:23:00+11:00 : The gov't can't legislate againsr companies paying dividends - and it runs contrary to their current strategy of getting people to spend money to kick start the economy anyway. The RBA has no legislative powers.Australian banks are indeed stronger than European banks - who are largely insolvent.I prediction is that a dividend will be paid but it will be reduced. This is not the same situation as the GFC.

Me thinks if given a choice, the OZ banks will not follow their European/UK counterparts for various reasons eg: their SP will be underpressure and investors will lose confidence of their "unquestionably strong" capital position.  If the government/RBA were to legislate this, then it goes against one of the government policies of temporarily reducing superannuation minimum payment amounts by 50% for retirees. The idea is not to force the sale of shares/assets to fund the retirees' livelihood......
