2017-06-05T12:17:00+10:00 : i note the bank chairmans/ceo have not mentioned government wastage and overspending in their letter to shareholders.

further to the speech by Trump on the reasons to withdraw from the paris accord has highlighted the wealth transfer from australia to developing nations.
all in the name of saving the planet. i am not against saving the planet. however australia is paying and transferring wealth to developing nations under the current arrangements.
australia in into job killing policies that close our cheap electricity plants whereas nations like India and China can carry on building coal plants for 13 years.

foreign aid is another big money wasting venture the governing have spending on.

in summary the budget big hole was caused by the government wasteful spending and bank shareholder are forced to pay for them. how about the government mp, senators and commonwealth employee tax their own salary to pay off the budget big hole that they caused?
