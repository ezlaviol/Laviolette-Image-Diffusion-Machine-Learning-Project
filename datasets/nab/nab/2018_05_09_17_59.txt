2018-05-09T17:59:00+10:00 : Next week 3 of the 4 big banks go ex-div. Then it is 6 months away before dividend time comes again. With the collapse of CBA today the only thing holding up NAB and the other two, are next weeks dividend. I expect greater than a $1.41 drop in the SP by the middle of next week, so looking around $27 which would be a buy IMO. Return on dividend only, would be higher than 10% gross, plus the potential for a rebound in SP, but it could take time.
