They currently have a competitive advantage over players outside of the Big4 in the form of large physical branch networks and can use customer service as a differentiator. For decades, this has also proved to be a high barrier entry for new players and the mortgage market, and the banks have flourished in a quasi oligolopy.But we now have this digital shift and a generation of customers coming through into the mortgage market who are accustomed to managing their entire lives online. They will have none of the reservations about buying mortgages online that older generations have, and the relevance of branches and customer service will slowly decline, making mortgages essentially a commodity. Online-only lenders can offer cheaper rates as they don't have the high fixed cost bases that the traditional Big4 have.So it is an interesting discussion on where the fine line is between keeping the branches as a competitive advantage vs unloading for a fixed cost reduction
