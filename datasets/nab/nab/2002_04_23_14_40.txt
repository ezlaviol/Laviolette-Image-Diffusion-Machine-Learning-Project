As a shareholder in NAB I am delighted with its performance overall.What concerns me is when any company does not disclose the full information to its shareholders. In this instance NAB has stated that it has complied with the rules.However, there are so many companies out there who do not disclose everything they should and, as investors, we must continually be seeking out that kind of information.  Many of our larger companies have subsidiaries in the UK or America, and the Financial Newspapers of those countries often reveal information not available here.For example, when the BHP-Billeton merger was on the go, there was more information available in the Financial Times than here some days. If I want to discover what Bank of Scotland are thinking of doing with their holding in Bankwest I always get the information first in the Scottish papers.
