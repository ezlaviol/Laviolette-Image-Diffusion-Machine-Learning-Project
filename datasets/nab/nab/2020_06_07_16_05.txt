2020-06-07T16:05:00+10:00 : I assume you are referring to my post. I do hope you are right. But I still believe that we don't understand the full affects of the shutdown.  For instance I haven't found one economist yet who has argued against it taking years for employment to reach pre Covid levels. Immigration has stalled completelythere was large unemployment pre Covidbank lending has become more strict ( even though rates fallen)a large number of mortgagors have taken up the offer of a repayment freezein not anti bank , I held Nab until last week, but when I look at all the various sectors aof the ASX , banking to me seems to have the biggest unknowns and highest risks for investors in the short term.  Once again I do hope that Nab proves me wrong,( and you won't get me coming back saying I told you so if I am right ) as Nab for any investor should be bought on basis of long term yield first, capital appreciation second. good luck to all.
