2020-05-27T14:25:00+10:00 : Did I say $20 by Xmas, silly me, i meant by the end of the week.Currently up over $4 from the SPP price, profit takers knock it down a tad, then there’s still plenty of upside.Going on Sircorps info, I reckon I’ll end up with about 210 shares. Not as many as I’d hoped for, but I’ll get a refund of approx of 7k.Average will come down.It is what it is.Not entirely unhappy.
