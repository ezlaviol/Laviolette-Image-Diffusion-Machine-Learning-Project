I’ll be extremely disappointed if we get a few grand worth under each holding account, yet a few fund managers grab $3bn of shares at $14.15 and get an instant performance boost claiming they are superior to index funds when in reality all they did was get a discounted large share issue. All of which may lead to an overpaid performance fee for no skill whatsoever.Still in my view, should have been a rights issue that was underwritten. The banks still charged $39m I read for finding a few fund managers. Absurd. Let’s see what happens.
