Not sure if any shares were in the green today - I know none of mine were.Anyone with funds enough to buy into NAB today as a  future focused investment would probably not worry about the knockers now.

yup, denial at its finest.the more they lose the more they buythis is why warren buffett said most people should just buy index funds. what's the point when a 5% dividend can be wiped out in ONE DAY by a fall in the share price or a DIVIDEND SCRAPPAGE
