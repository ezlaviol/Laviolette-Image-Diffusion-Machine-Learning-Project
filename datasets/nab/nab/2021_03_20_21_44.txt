2021-03-20T21:44:00+11:00 : the post that was moderated. I will edit out the "sensitive stuff" for Management to act on for the benefit of all shareholders. NAB should do what? Merge business and residential division like Westpac. COVID will still be lingering in the economy. Merge and cut down the workforce cut more people! Especially those heads getting $300k+ per year doing what? Wasting our shareholder's money!!. Close more branches nobody goes to branches nowadays hence why Nab bought 86400.I was a broker. We can't write business loans they all have to route all through their NAB business bankers. Come on plenty of room to cut costs outsource to brokers. CBA was very successful in this regard brokers could write business loans! Seems to keep a "Smaller" number of business bankers. A lot of small business will be wiped out. Why do we need a large number of business bankers? And also a dedicated business division? Hope Nab management read this. Further cut costs, cut those over $200k+++++++ salary people replace with more capable $150k people. close more branches. Merge the business and residential division. Like Westpac. We as shareholders will continue to support the management!
