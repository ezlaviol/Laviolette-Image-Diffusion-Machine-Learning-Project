2020-04-27T23:42:00+10:00 : first from the four big B will get out Covid but severely wounded though...there is a light at the end of the tunnel...smart move by NAB because of other banks have to raise now they have to offer a bit more discount than NAB...a collective effect of 15b raise by banks will bring down the SP to following NAB: 12 to 13 buy ANZ: 12.5 to 13.5 buyCBA: 45 to 50 buyWBC: 11.5 to 12.5 buywith not much of divis in one year & potential of further downside IMO banks are still overvalued...lucky are those who sold at 17$
