2018-08-21T12:40:00+10:00 : If they did kick Turnbull out they would be committing political suicide. Public are tired of the PM revolving door.  Australians want stability.  Turnbull hasn't done a bad job and IMO is getting better. Dutton's performance in Immigration hasn't been good.  Australians are having an immigration problem similar to the situation with the US and Mexico. This immigration problem was rife during the ALP years in power.

Instability within the Libs will probably reflect in a softer SP for banks. Libs are pro banks. Turnbull likes the banking sector to be strong as he feels this is positive for our economy and IMO I think he's right.

Uncertainty once again will not be positive for banks. But still look to the positive side.  The uncertainty and instability may be short lived.  In the meantime enjoy your dividends
