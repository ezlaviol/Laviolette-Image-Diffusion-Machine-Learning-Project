2016-07-22T22:44:00+10:00 : Lowest I bought is 73.35, which is not great seeing it went down to 70 something I think. Thing is I have a twitchy trigger finger and I tend to jump in too early (early in, late out - improving though). Also, price of entry is high and with CBA I am only really slowly accumulating so anything below 75 I am happy with at the moment, as in the long term it will make little difference. CBA is LT for me, though if it hits high 80's and Trump looks like winning I will be selling.....

Judging by previous years (I know that does not predict the future), banks tend to climb from now on at this time of the year so, assuming CBA, etc reports coming out soon are OK, I would expect them all to climb so I am hoping NAB drifts up considerably. I do not think it will hang below 26 for much longer, but you never know what disaster is around the corner. Also, RBA looks like may cut in August, which I am thinking will push them up as people look for yield.

All speculation of course. They could all go down the gurgler tomorrow, which would be bad for me as I am currently at something like 40-50% in banks , with NAB being the biggest chunk.
