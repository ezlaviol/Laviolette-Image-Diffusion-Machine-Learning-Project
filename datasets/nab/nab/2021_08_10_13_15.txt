2021-08-10T13:15:00+10:00 : I still have a few NAB in my super fund I paid $30 for 12 years ago that's how to go backwards ,NAB have raised money from shareholders made some very poor investments and lost money ,sold off some of their businesses and after raising money they are buying back shares,management are out of ideas to grow the business.Contrast the NAB share price in 2009 I bought some for around $14 and I also got some Macquarie at $18 .
