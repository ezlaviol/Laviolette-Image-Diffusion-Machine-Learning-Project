2018-11-01T09:40:00+11:00 : NAB was always going to deliver on its dividend. At 99 that's 1.98 annually. In other words after factoring in franking credits that's over 10%. You cant get a better return in oz anywhere.Some here have questioned NABs growth in sp which is a fair enough argument. After  we can see the back of the RC this share price will crack 30 and that would be nearly a 25% gain from where the sp is atm.Enjoy dividends.  SP IMO will be flat until results from RC are finalised. If the findings are manageable from a business perspective expect $1 something for your next interim dividendStackey
