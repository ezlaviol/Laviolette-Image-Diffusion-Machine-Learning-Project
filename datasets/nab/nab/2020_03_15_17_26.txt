2020-03-15T17:26:00+11:00 : Friday was a blatant pump by all the central banks desperate to create a green close to avoid millions of investors dwelling on their losses and expectations for more over the weekend and planning their exit Monday.it was so obviously so in Aust and even more so in the USA timed to make Trump' s announcement on a state of emergency look positive.  They slammed gold at the same time to sheperd the sheep to stay in stocks.in a GFC situation this could work.  Save the big banks and get everyone spending with green shoot type stories.  But now with lock downs on the way who will spend, who will travel, who will start a business? Those in business will be facing no cashflow for a long time, the casual and gig workers will be freaking.  How can  a green close on one Friday in March help them as the months roll on with consumers staying home and ducking out to buy groceries and not much else?  How can government support them all?
