2020-03-22T21:52:00+11:00 : well by the sounds of it, 15% down tomorrow. It appears we are about to move into a full lock down. From everything Iâ€™ve heard to date, this will be at least until August minimum.By that time, we will have 2 - 3 quarters of 0 GDP. With the stimulus to date, would only equate to 10% of the losses.Basically we are totally screwed.The stimulus is unfair and has too many gaps.My advice buy a gun. Takes 28 days, best investment you can make.unfair stimulus = crime/riotingThings are about to get real. Buckle up folks, we about to enter a new world.
