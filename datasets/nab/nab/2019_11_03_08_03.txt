While flat at the moment it is up 26% from its lows over the last 12 months and that is hardly a downward trend.I will say that I don't think we will see $30 for a while but holding around $28 is a firm possibility. Still a better option to hold NAB shares than depositing cash in the bank.

You have pointed out a " Trade " which is exactly my point . NAB is below the price it was in 1999 high , that my friend is a buy and hold dead duck with ZERO capital gains . Stick a linear regression on 20 years of NAB  . it slopes down , i rest my case . Sure it has enough Beta to be a good trader but if you have bought this long term over that period you are underperforming the market . NAB is in a 20 year downtrend , why am i having this conversation its as clear as day and irrefutable
