Well that is what assets are for, buying, holding and selling at a profit, hopefully.
Banks are always buying and selling assets, it is what they do as they don't hold much cash.
I don't see it as a downside unless they make a loss of course but even then it depends on where the business was going and whether it was making a loss.

We will see.
