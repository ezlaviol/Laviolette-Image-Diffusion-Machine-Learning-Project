If you were to place the investment on DRP or average down when you cand and the SP was to get back to $30, you will definitely beat the bank...probably beat the bank even at $25 - 26. Even after GFC the SP came back rose by around $5-8 in a couple of years. I guess it is about the timeframe and the kind of return one expect to make over the next 3 years.

If you are expecting a 100% return on investments..then banks are not the place for you anyway.
