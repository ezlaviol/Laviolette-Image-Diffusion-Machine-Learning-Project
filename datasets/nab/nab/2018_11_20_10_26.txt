2018-11-20T10:26:00+11:00 : Think about it this way, how many people with a few $100,000 sitting in their accounts are waiting for a good price?

How many millionaires in AUS are sitting there for a good price.

How many people are pulling equity out of their hole ready to jump in at a good price....

The royal commission final round ends on the 30/11.

I've only been trading for 2 years and can tell you by using simple common sense that it should pop in December after the royal commission has stopped punching the banks.

This is my opinion only I'm in at $24.90 and would have sold but no point, if the world goes bad I would rather hold bank stocks due to the amount of money they have. 

NAB is still a stock that even though I'm down 11k I dont really care, I'm selling my investment property soon and if it goes lower I'll be buying more.

Warren Buffett just bought a tone of USA Bank stocks and that guy is the heavy weight champion in this game.

Royal Commission has created a buying opportunity and in a few weeks we'll all be saying "why didn't I buy more?" "Why did I sell?"

It happens every time, NAB is a blue chip stock it's not some stock that cant survive a GFC.. it already has!

Stop crying and start reading about ur next move.

Dyor all information is my opinion only.
