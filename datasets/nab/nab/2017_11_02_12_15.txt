2017-11-02T12:15:00+11:00 : Australian shares were flat on Thursday as gains in the materials sector on an uptick in metal prices were counteracted by losses in financials as National Australia Bank's (NAB) results revealed slipping margins.  	The S&P/ASX 200 index (xjo) was nearly unchanged at 5,937.2 by 0052 GMT. The benchmark rose 0.5 percent on Wednesday.   	The country's No.3 lender by market value, NAB, slipped as much as 3.3 percent, its biggest percentage loss since May 16, after it said it foresees a spike in expenses between five to eight percent over the year ahead and it would cut 6,000 jobs by 2020. 	The Melbourne-based bank said its annual cash profit rose 2.5 percent to a record high although it expects A$500 million to A$800 million in restructuring costs in the first half of fiscal 2018. 	"One of the big plays in banks globally is the steepening of yield curves," said Damien Hennessy, co-founder of Heuristic Investment Systems. 	"A lot of the Australian banksâ€™ loans are on variable rates, they do not really benefit from the steepening yield curve which has supported some of the banks globally." 	The financial index slipped as much as 0.9 percent, led lower by NAB. It trades at a Price to Earnings ratio of 14.98, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.  	"Our banks have been very expensive relative to global peers and the banks are just coming back to the pack, somewhat, in the past few months," added Hennessy.
