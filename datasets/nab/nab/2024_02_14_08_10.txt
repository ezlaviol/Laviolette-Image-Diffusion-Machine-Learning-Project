The banks in Australia have underperformed for some time, probably due to their poor performance on money laundering, frauds, scams, complaints, retail banking, bad loans, conduct and poor regulatory behaviors.Not to mention chronic understaffing, poor Boards, poor CEOs and atrocious management.The schools and colleges in Australia should teach students their consumer protection rights, financial sense, regulation and this would improve how banks behave.
