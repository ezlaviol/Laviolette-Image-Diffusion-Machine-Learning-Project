Are some politicians believing that Nationalising the Banks might be even see better results should remember last time a government, an ALP Government ran a bank or banks they all went broke in Vic , SA to name just two. Remember  State Savings Bank of Victoria ?.the CBA saved Victoria in circa 1991 after State Bank  went broke in 1990.
