2020-04-14T08:40:00+10:00 : Just been looking at a report on where banks are at the moment - and the report centred on WBC but that can be expanded to all banks.The situation in Australia re: dividends is somewhat different to the overseas situation - Europe for example has ordered its banks to cancel dividends. I Australia, banks have been orderd to do some stress testing to support any dividends being paid to share holders rather than not pay any dividends. I suspect this is to support superannuation as bank dividends make up a large proportion of income in that area.So, we can expect a significant reduction in dividends for at least the next round of dividends (in NAB's case that is in July) and.potentially, the December dividend ay also be affected.  I also think that the SP may take a short term hit when those are announced in May. Quite possible that we could see a 50 cent dividend. All in all, not as bad as has been suggested - but not that good either of course - but again, this is in the short term.Unless the crisis worsens and get a  repeat performance in 2021, we may well see a return to somewhere near normality in 2021.
