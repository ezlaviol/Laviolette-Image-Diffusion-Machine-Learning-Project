2018-11-21T15:53:00+11:00 : As NAB will liquidate its small China trust investment, as well asÂ look to sell MLC, the dividend is not under threat.NAB pays $1.98 per annum + $0.84857 franking credits attached.That means NAB is yielding almost 12%!!Not as cheap as my CAF (Centrepoint Alliance on 1x ex cash PE) but I'll take 12% thank you very much.
