Can't get through on the phone and they don't give compensation. Its time to say bye bye NABTrade and NAB banking as a whole you useless fools and the even more useless executives that run it. They should be sacked the lot of them for not investing capital in IT and hiring quality personnel that know how to test in a non-live environment first before switching the systems back on for the public.
