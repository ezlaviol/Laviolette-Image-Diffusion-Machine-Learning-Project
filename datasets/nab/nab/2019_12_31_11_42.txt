Judging an Australian Banks ranking on being "digitally able" by going on an ASB site is laughable.
You again mention that ANZ & WBC to have the "best" based on "evidence" 
Again, what evidence?? - they're just your words...........(we keep asking but get nothing)
Also you conclude that CBA has the "worst" based on fines, breaches and the AML situation yet WBC is currently waiting on a conclusion to the biggest AML scandal of the lot.
Apparently you believe that in CBA's case the Austrac issue is significant re their digital ability but not for WBC
If you read the RC findings you would know that all the banks suffered in various areas with financial planning and Insurance being main problem areas for all.
NAB unfortunately was poorly portrayed because of the recalcitrant attitude of the previous leaders. NAB's name has again been brought up in the media due to charges to be laid however these are in regard to issues already addressed (and indeed remediation), however it is obvious many just read headlines 
(Getting a clear message here is impossible so I will take more heed of Rocksinmyhead's advice!)
