My crystal ball is broken! The market changed hardly at all on the rate hold so already factored in. I didn't take anything personal today. Market down across all sectors. I know that doesn't answer your question but what yr asking is to predict the future and its not something I'm a fan of. Buy the dip, when others are fearful, keep some powder dry and never go all in 
That's what I think anyway!
