Hi gents could I kindly ask for some assistance with TA.

There has been a recent sell off with NAB shares with a considerable volume prior going to ex -dividend

Could kindly please advise what the charts are saying with this in view? What is seen as Support / resistance on the charts?

Thanks in advance
