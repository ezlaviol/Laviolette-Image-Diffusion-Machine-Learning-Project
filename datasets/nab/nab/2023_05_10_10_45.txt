2023-05-10T10:45:00+10:00 : I made a cheeky bid this morning- not triggered- thought it was looking too good to be true.Interesting sentiment and macro for banks at the moment- happy to buy but not going to pay a premium.I have a low offer on a rival bank going ex-div tomorrow. Still some cash to see what tax loss selling season has to offer.IMHO DYOR
