2020-05-12T14:05:00+10:00 : At some point we've got to have the difficult conversation about an acceptable level of death. Public health and the health of the economy are one and the same. We can't shut the economy down in the hope of saving lives from covid19, it will cost much more lives in the long run, especially in developing countries. I think the key is to working smarter by using tracking apps and social distancing etc but with the media keeping a running score board on covid19 deaths I fear the panic is going to prevail every time we have a spike. Studies coming out of Germany are indicating a mortality rate of 0.3%, still a pretty high number but we need to see it in context. We've got to manage those at risk and continue business. By locking down and eroding our tax base we'll have far greater health issues in years to come.
