2020-08-17T15:03:00+10:00 : 5 years? Well all have herd immunity then, Spanish flu was no different. I agree the travel industry is stuffed for years to come. We also don’t need the globe to have a vaccine, I doubt the tin pot countries will get it anytime soon. Just as Ebola still runs rampant as with MERS in a couple of crap holes.Link brexit and wars? Cmon. I’m a capitalist and I would have voted for brexit for short term pain, long term gain. The EU stinks and it’s abused. A world war between super powers is highly unlikely, zero sum game. Fighting third world crap holes, well yea, that has occurred since the dawn of time and won’t stop. A couple of super powers using muscle to take some land is unlikely to start a world war, it’s not ideal, however again zero sum games.
