2019-10-04T08:41:00+10:00 : bit like the NAB systems, all show but no action. They say McEwen is going to Melbourne not Sydney to live and work which given that NAB was most effective when Sydney based execs like Argus, Cicutto, Coyne ran the show but failed when Thorburn, Chronican etc run it, does not bode well.
