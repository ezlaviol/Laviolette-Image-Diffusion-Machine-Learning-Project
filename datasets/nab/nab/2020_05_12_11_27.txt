(At least most of the nonsense pointing to Swedens lack of lock down has stopped - given their death rate) 
Of course most of the comments completely ignores why the measures were put in place
Your economic comment is fair and a point which needs to be considered before making decisions. The jury is very much out on the shape of the recovery but little doubt banks could be in for a rough ride for a while. Nothing to say they (or the market) won't go lower but as always trying to pick bottoms or tops is fraught!!
Of course this will be a sector issue, not confined to a particular bank (which some will just ignore)
Very much a case of DYOR and make conscious decisions.........................
