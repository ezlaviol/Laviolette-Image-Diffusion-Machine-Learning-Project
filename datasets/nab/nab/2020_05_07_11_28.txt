Also if i get 1000 from the SPP thats all i would sell - and even then it is only to record a capital loss against some other trading i have been doing.I think everyone knows the sums just depends on their risk assessment and what cash they like to hold etc, but overall the SPP is really good value IMO, like money for Jam. I did the whole $30k.
