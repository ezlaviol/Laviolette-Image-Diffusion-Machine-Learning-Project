2018-11-21T19:05:00+11:00 : I've added a few thousand shares to the portfolio at under $24, it does seem very cheap given the yield, plus the franking credits will be very handy!!
If you go back to some old history, back between 2003-2006, NAB paid a yearly dividend of mid 160c/a, yet spent a lot of that time with a share price up to 50% higher than now, plus it was only partially franked (90% in 2006).
Even in 2009 at the depth of the GFC the dividend was only 'cut' to 144c/a (about 15%). IMHO even if the dividend was cut 33% from present, it is still a bargain, and I doubt that will happen.
