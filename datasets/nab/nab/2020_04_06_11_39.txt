It is important to have stats on the other conditions contributing to deaths, & long hospitalisation putting great pressure on facilities.Maybe Sweden will confirm a trend from a more open society. Probably too late to change course now, even if anyone was prepared to buck the system. I think most will suffer from being "Stir Crazy". I'm already a contender.Cheers, Japes.
