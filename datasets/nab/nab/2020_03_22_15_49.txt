For those who have an open mind, like to know more about what is happening, why it's happening and what is likely to happen in the future I would like to point you to a simulation about this called Event 201. It took place on Friday, October 18, 2019 in New York only months before this started. I will give you the link to the site. I strongly encourage you to watch the videos. By the way today March 22 is a very significant date. I am on Twitter if anyone wants to contact me. I am sure you can work out how to find me if you were meant to do so. I truly wish you all the best in dealing with this as our Nation now goes into lock down.http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/
