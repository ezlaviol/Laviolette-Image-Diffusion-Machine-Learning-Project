Thank you, JID, and bellenuit, and everybody else for your replay. I was a bit worried, it had to do with NAB directly.As for tips, I think the best is to invest in good companies that pay good dividends for the long term. The rest, takes care by itself.Thank you again.Please note, my posts are all in good faith, and they are not to be taken as financial advise to anybody. DYOR.
