2019-04-18T12:35:00+10:00 : The real question is to what extent a div cut/profit fall is already factored into the current share price. A 10% cut in the div would save NAB about $530m pa, enough to cover the provision. At current prices it would also equate to 7% ff div. So arguably that is already built in and there shouldn't be much impact on the share price. Anything greater than that might "surprise" the market and result in a further sell down. Given the wording of the announcement re the div, NAB may take a leaf out of ANZs book and formally set a (lower) target payout ratio.
