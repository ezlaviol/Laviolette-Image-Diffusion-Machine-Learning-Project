Sub $20 will look very cheap. No need to stress over the current SP anyway.Banks are an excellent long term investment - and repay investors over a longer time span.

Good buying at these levels imo - backed up the truck today at 17.38Think the banks will go on a run soon imo, it’s been a while and every now and then they explode which is overdue!
