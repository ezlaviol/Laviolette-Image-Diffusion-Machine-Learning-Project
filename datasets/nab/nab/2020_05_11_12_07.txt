2020-05-11T12:07:00+10:00 : I think the SPP will be massively oversubscribed and that most retail investors will be very disappointed with their allocations.NAB market cap is approx $50b and SPP is only $500m.A quick look at last years annual report:There were 333,000 small shareholders with less than 1000 shares.There were 189,000 small shareholders with less than 5000 shares.Just these two smallest groups of shareholders is 522,000 shareholders.Divide $500 SPP by 522,000 if every shareholder subscribed they would each only get $955 dollars worth of shares lol.So:a) I definately wouldn't be selling my existing shares on market in the hope that I can get the equivalent number of shares back in the share placement.b) Unless they massively increase the $500m SPP, I very much doubt shareholders will get anything close to $30,000 allocation.  My feeling is that those that only subscribe to a small qty will get their allocation, but those trying to get a larger allocation will have their allocation cut significantly.
