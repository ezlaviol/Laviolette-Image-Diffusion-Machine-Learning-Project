2020-06-10T16:56:00+10:00 : My wife's share certificate arrived by mail today, a day after my refund (paid by cheque came).Going by the mailhouse numbers, cheques may have accounted for 15 to 20 per cent of the refunds.  High considering the banks fail to promote cheques these days.  So I'd hope for Sydney, you get your refund tomorrow or at absolute worst on Friday.
