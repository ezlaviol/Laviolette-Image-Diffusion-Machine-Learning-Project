2023-08-17T07:59:00+10:00 : I hear you.  The markets are certainly wobbling. I am one of those people that loves bad news and shaky markets. Yesterday i purchased some BHP both for me and my son's accounts, and it did cross my mind to sell my NAB and move it across. But I have been guilty of catching the falling knife a few times so I didn't go too hard.I am going to hang in there with NAB and wait for that$32. The yield is strong and that is primarily what I target so NAB fits well into my basket. It  might take a year or two (or never) but NAB suits my plans.
