2019-11-14T16:56:00+11:00 : JC - I got some more at 27.65 and I think the SP has another 50-70 cents in it in November. Maybe a little punt will make you a quick profit even if you are not comfortable with holding NAB for any length of time.

I thought of buying NAB endive, took a look at this report and the lack of progress, and counselled myself against it. This go slow seems worse than AMP, not as bad as outset perhaps but this dog ain’t hunting any better IMHO.remediation seems painful.
