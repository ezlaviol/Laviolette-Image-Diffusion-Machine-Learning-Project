Something like what they spent in 6 months during the GFC.  All that to get a green close and save the banking system from locking up.can they repeat that over and over? What nessage does that send to the market - everything under control or maybe  things are way worse than we can imagine?sure, you can trade their pumps but you aint in the club to know when they will step in.  Goldman would know. Their aim will be to wrong foot everyone outside the club.  Maybe a lot of people will head for the exits and start to sell the fffing pump STFP and exit to cash to wait it out leaving a slow stepladder down with the reality of shocking financial results from airlines, banks, retail - in fact almost everyone making the pumps look increasingly ridiculous.also the Central banks will only buy the main index stocks.  The rest will will keep sinking.Major banks are a protected species though.
