Gain of 5-10%. NAB trading below book value. Biggest concern is whether SME's and home owners can pay back their loans. But government is going all in to stop SME's going under while at the same time working to keep people in jobs. I think the gov't measures will be successful. If so, there's no reason for banks to trade at ~20% discount to their net assets worth. Could be like the GFC all over again, when CBA went to $15, WBC low teens, etc - because everyone thought there would be mass defaults coming. But then Rudd unleashed a wave of spending, everyone kept their jobs, and the bank share prices went right back up within a few years.
