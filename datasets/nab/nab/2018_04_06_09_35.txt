The government will send the bill to the public purse thanks to taxpayers and the banks may pay a penalty (also just another tax) and get advice on what they already know. Everyone gives themselves a pat on the back and onward. Mind you there really should be a RC on politicians pay packets as they sure are not in line with CPI. All IMO I am a squirrel....
