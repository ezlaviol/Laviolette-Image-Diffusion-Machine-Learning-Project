2015-05-13T11:11:00+10:00 : I never said I was short NAB. In none of my NAB posts have I stated that I was short. Just that I do not like the stock technically and fundamentally. And I believe in time it would move lower. That does not mean it can not have short term rallies. The stock is oversold and a short move up is not out of the question. That said i would short NB hard, if it can have a decent rally. Any company requiring a capital raising. Has a serious fundamental problems. That need looking at. Just because institutions are willing to prop up a dying company with a cash injection. Does not make it worth investing in. What happens if things do not improve. Then they will require a second, third, fourth capital raising. When is enough a enough.
