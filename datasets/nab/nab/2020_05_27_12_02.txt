At the moment I'm venting my anger at NAB management as best I can ( I assume that they sometimes read HC) as for your suggestion "make some assumptions and plan around those"  .... believe it or not,   I have tried that ....  but I do quite like to know how much assets I have (   yes, thats sarcasm )
