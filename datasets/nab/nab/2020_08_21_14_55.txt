2020-08-21T14:55:00+10:00 : What has Scotland got to do with Australia?Scotland is a very minor part of the UK economy  - it is arguably no more independent than an Australian state.  Until 2019 Scotland was also part of the EU which over 500 million potential buyers who could legally live in Scotland. UK and foreign buyers were the ones that caused the Scottish market to recover. Australia is totally different. Our real estate market (particularly Sydney and Melbourne) was based on a massive migration Ponzi scheme which sold (second rate) education and migration as a package deal.  Covid has put an end to that. The property Ponzi scheme has now collapsed. Migration has plummeted. The US (which buys very little from Australia and runs a massive trade surplus) has dragged us into a trade war with our most important trading partner China. Things are likely to get very nasty for the Australian economy.
