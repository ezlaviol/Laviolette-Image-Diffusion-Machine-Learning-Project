Chronican is not blaming the regulators for the poor result (and certainly not shifting responsibility for any of the Banks failures)
He is talking about the impact uncertain regulatory issues are having on lending to small business. He cites ASIC's continued action in the courts which is leaving uncertainty how they are able to lend to small business and this has caused a bottleneck in NAB's lending to small business.
Little doubt the Government are acutely aware of this issue and are trying to sort out new legislation. (The last thing the Government will want is a continued slow down in small business lending)
All the Banks will just want clarity on what will be legislated and also what the Courts decide!!
All fair and reasonable comments and hardly a position that should cause any harsher scrutiny by regulators
