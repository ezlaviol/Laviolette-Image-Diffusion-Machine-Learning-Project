2019-01-23T11:53:00+11:00 : HMMMMMMMMM...........$24.35 low then a bounce up to $24.63 around mid day. I have been working on a retrace circa $24 area based on recent range of $23 to $25. I know NAB went to $22.52 but that was an overshoot in my book. All stocksÂ can overshoot to the up side or down side as stops get triggered.Should I have re-entered below $24.40 ?? or do I wait to see if my target of $24 is reached. Probably will see a lot of support at $24 but if broken $23.50 could pop up pretty quickly.Maybe another strategy would be to average in buying 500 shares at a time. Brokerage under $20 bucks so not too hard to swallow. Bottom fishing can be bumpy but I am looking to add 10000 shares so its important to get it right.Any crystal balls out there ?
