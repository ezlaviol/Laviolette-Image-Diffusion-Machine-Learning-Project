Not when the thread was started and the Virus was definitely about.I agree with you and have been saying it will get ugly especially in the USA.I am glad you aren't fixed in your thinking and won't consider an alternate view as that to my mind is the best benefit of Hot Copper to get opposing view.My issue is often you only get positive views on whichever stock you are following.  because the people who follow usually have bought and think it is a good pick and want to validate their thoughts.And to the people who say that posters are trying to manipulate the market, I think Hot Copper followers would make a minute number of holders of shares.  I think they want to share their opinion and give fair warning if they think negatively.Good luck to all holders
