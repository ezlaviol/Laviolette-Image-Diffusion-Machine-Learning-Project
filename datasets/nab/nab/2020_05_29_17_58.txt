2020-05-29T17:58:00+10:00 : Just wondering if anyone has had their allocation SPP stocks added to their holdings yet?I am in WA and Paid BPay 10K 15.15 Hrs Tuesday 19th May  to Computershare  from a NAB account which according to their stated close off time of  1700 WA or 1900 Melbourne time Friday 22nd should surely be received in time.Held 2500 and couldn't  resist the $19 dollars offered on 28th so sold 200 to fund another purchase but still nothing on my Nabtrade account.Can't get anyone on either Nabtrade or Computershare so just thought I would ask the question here.Cheers
