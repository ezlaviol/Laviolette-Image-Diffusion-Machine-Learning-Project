2016-06-28T13:53:00+10:00 : They are holding up well which is a bit of a surprise.

Again things will be determine by markets overnight, i didnt get anymore NAB today i waited too long this morning when they went down close to 2%. Keeping my cash ready though and searching for some value elsewhere as well.

Ive got a large holding in NAB already so im not too fussed if they go down ( i can buy more) or if they go up (i can sleep better).

GW getting the lows, lets see how this plays out.
