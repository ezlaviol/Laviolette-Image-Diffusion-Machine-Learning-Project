2016-02-09T15:29:00+11:00 : The overseas banks may be reluctant to raise interest rates,  doubt Australian banks so reluctant.

First difference is the Australian Reserve Bank has been forcing the Oz banks to exercise harder for quite a while, unlike many overseas.

Second difference is the Oz banks do NOT accept the keys and let borrowers walk away from their outstanding loans.


Only reluctance of Oz banks raising interest rates, is with making their calculations as to whether they lose more  from being first, second or last to do it...  will the borrowers lost be an advantage or a disadvantage concerning needing to foreclose...
