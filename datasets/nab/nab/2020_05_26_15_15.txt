So, the small guy with 20 shares putting $30K, would get much less than the big guy with 1M shares putting $30K. In all likelihood, taking my example, the small guy would probably only get less than $1K worth of his $30K (or whatever minimum NAB would set), while the big guy will get all his $30K. Fair or not, that's how it work with other similar SPP. The smaller investor can only hope for no scale back, to be honest.
