2020-04-25T09:41:00+10:00 : Not so - Brazil halted its trial (news overnight) because the drug was actually proving lethal. Don't know where your information comes from but doctors and hospitals in the US are saying it is making matters worse for patients and there are heaps of side affects as well.

It was a BS Chinese trial, which they stopped because they “couldn’t get enough patients”, meanwhile they were trying to patent the drug themselves.Anyone selling on this news will be sorely disappointed, word from US doctors and hospitals is that it’s a winner. Wait for the US results at the end of next week.
