2023-08-26T19:28:00+10:00 : I made a couple of fortunate trades.  Sold my NAB at 28.30 for a handsome profit on the 24th.  I jumped straight into GrainCorp at its lowest on the same day. Next day 25th NAB dropped so I sold Graincorp. Made myself a quick $500 and bought back into NAB at 27.90.I have rarely had such luck in timing.  But anyway, I am back here for the long run if required.   You inspired me Frog.  lol
