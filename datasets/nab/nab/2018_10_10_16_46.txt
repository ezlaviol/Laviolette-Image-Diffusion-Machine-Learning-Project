2018-10-10T16:46:00+11:00 : I can't remember which bank it was but didn't one of the other three "re base" their dividend in the last 18 months and actually experience a rise in SP as a result? Definitely in the case of NAB there has been a fear that the dividend might not be sustainable so when/if the cut happens and its relatively small it can actually have a reverse effect as it removes the uncertainty going forward.
