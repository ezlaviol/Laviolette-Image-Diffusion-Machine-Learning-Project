2020-09-04T05:54:00+10:00 : Just a  warning - Banks may get a real hit today. DOW was down 1,000 points for most of the night and are currently down 900 points. This should flow through to the banks (blue chips really) in todays trade. Could be some good prices in the morning on the ASX is accumulation is the game.

Yep they shouldnt move up far and quickly from here, and if they do, its on the back of great news.  Still they are a buy at these prices.
