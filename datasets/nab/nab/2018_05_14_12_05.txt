But the thing is if the SP goes up before the XD (in significant amount) that is when you should sell. Because the SP is going to tank after the XD.  That is because the big players sell before the XD so the retail holders will buy.

But on the other hand if the SP goes down in before XD the SP do not get tanked after the XD. DYOR that is what I have seen over the years. If there is investors out there that would like to keep hold of NAB for another 3-4 months, rewards can be reaped.

Look at ANZ, Friday closed @ 28.15 with 80c fully franked today going XD. but the SP did go down by 80c and considering the franking, ANZ should have gone down more than the 2.7% currently. The dividend yeild is 5.7% against, current NAB 7.0%
