2020-04-29T07:46:00+10:00 : NAB will go back to $19-$20 post crisis as long as it’s contained and a recovery occurs. Just look at the GFC. Only difference is we won’t have significant credit growth to get it to $30s. You’ll find the dividend goes back to probably $1.20-$1.40pa within 18 months as well. It’s a good buy at $15-$17.
