2019-01-07T18:04:00+11:00 : That's not quite correct as I understand it. Exempt are Self Managed Super Fund Retirees who were in pension mode on or before 31 Mar 2018 or anybody in receipt of Government welfare payments (e.g. Age Pension).

The ones who are not exempt include Self Managed Super Fund Retirees who entered pension mode after 31 Mar 2018 and any self-funded retiree who does not receive a government handout.

Thus a self-funded retiree who lives on a small industry fund allocated pension plus a few share dividends and has assets exceeding $803k doesn't get an age pension and can't claim franking credit refunds. Labour attacking industry fund members - bizarre.
