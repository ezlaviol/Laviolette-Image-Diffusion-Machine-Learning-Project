2020-05-30T18:10:00+10:00 : Some extracts from ATO about Tax on Investment or Trades..Shareholding as investmentA shareholder is a person who holds shares for the purpose of earning income from dividends and similar receipts. For a shareholder:1) the cost of purchase of shares is not an allowable deduction against current year income, but is a capital cost receipts from the sale of shares are not assessable income â€“ but any capital gain on the shares is subject to capital gains tax2) A net capital loss from the sale of shares can't be offset against income from other sources, but can be offset against another capital gain or carried forward to offset against future capital gains3) The transaction costs of buying or selling shares is not an allowable deduction against income, but are taken into account in determining the amount of any capital gain4) Dividends and other similar receipts from the shares are included in assessable incomecosts (such as interest on borrowed money) incurred in earning dividend income are an allowable deduction against current year income.---------------------------------------------------------------------------5) My understanding is, "Interest paid to Margin Lender or Borrowed Money is Tax Deductable (but dividend is treated as income) while trading losses can only be carried forward and adjusted against future profit. Any trading profit is taxed at same rate as normal person salary. No wonder why High Income Earner keeps holding shares them till retirement.
