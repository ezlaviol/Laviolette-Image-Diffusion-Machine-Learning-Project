As I mentioned in an earlier thread, the demerger and then the return of the remainder of funds over the Clydesdale litigation will be things to look forward to.

Personally I am happy that there wasn't a dividend increase. Cash is king right now. Hold back on short term reward and let this current board finish what it has started and partially completed so diligently. They have done in 12 months what the 2 senior management teams couldn't or wouldn't do.

Imagine what Thorburn will do for the business after he has finished repairing 15 years of previous management cock ups.
