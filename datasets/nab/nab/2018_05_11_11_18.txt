2018-05-11T11:18:00+10:00 : Buy ex dividend sub $28 imo. Will be 10% grossed up F/F yield.

I got more WBC on the RC rubbish sub $28 the other day. 

Only real value in the market at present is banks. But it’ll take time to turn. Wouldn’t touch AMP though as fund managers may leave in droves due to ethics and perception. Seems those gender politics on the boards didn’t pay off as in the end it was inexperience tokenism that really hit AMP (my personal opinion).
