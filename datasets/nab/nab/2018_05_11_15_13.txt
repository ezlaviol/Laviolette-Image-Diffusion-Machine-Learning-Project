2018-05-11T15:13:00+10:00 : long term holders looking to sell should do so on Monday. I imagine people will get in last minute to get the dividend. Long term holders will get good sale price at 50% discount (if they made a capital gain).
buyers looking to hold long term should wait until after Tuesday ex-dividend. I think it will drop below $28 and will be a great buy in.
If your looking long term even with RC into the banks the interest rates cant stay this low forever. Cash rate and subsequent rate rises in banks will be passed onto loan holders. This will be more profit for banks in the long term.
Having said this, the change in the economy is as long as a piece of string atm.
DYOR.
