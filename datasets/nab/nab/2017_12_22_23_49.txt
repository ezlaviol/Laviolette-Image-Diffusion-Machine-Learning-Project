2017-12-22T23:49:00+11:00 : I've restructured my portfolio and in the process resigned NAB shares to simply be one of two "back-stop" type holdings, aimed at maintaining some stability and delivering yield.

Not much else to say really, I was (and still am) waiting to see how any penalties/settlement pans out for CBA before re-entering there. If CBA cops a mighty whack and NAB remains relatively high then I will be poised to switch everything I have in NAB across to CBA but there are lots of "ifs" in that plan.
