CYBG's financials are horrible (see point number 4.8 of http://www.clydesdaledemerger.com.au/pages/Faq_StandAlone.aspx):

1. Losses of 225m, 190m, 44m and 647m pounds in each of 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012
2. Return on tangible equity (statutory basis) of negative 10%
3. Cost income ration of 75%. This suggests they just don't have sufficient scale to compete with the bigger banks.

I predict there will be at least one more year of further writedowns and deck clearing required before CYBG turns things around if at all
