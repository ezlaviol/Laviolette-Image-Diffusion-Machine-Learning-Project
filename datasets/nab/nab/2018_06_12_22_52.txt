2018-06-12T22:52:00+10:00 : I worked for NAB for 18 years.

Started as a young 16 year old straight from form 5 (now called year 11).

I stayed with the bank for 18 years. Worked up in Nugini as Stationery Officer for 2 years from 1975.
Then having completed my degree in Business Studies was appointed as a Cost Analyst and was party to introducing all those fees that everybody complains about now.

Point is, and this is the fact now as it was then. The bank makes it profit on the 2% difference between the lending rate and the deposit rate plus fees. This will never change.

The dividend rate of 6% has been much the same for many years. Thats the beauty of the big four.
