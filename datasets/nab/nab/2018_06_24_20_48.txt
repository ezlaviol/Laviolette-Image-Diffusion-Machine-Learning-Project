I would like to see a Royal Commission into the Health System..

-Doctors 
-Hospitals 
-Medical Services

They seem to be able to charge what ever they like............. not all but !!!

I sought a question from my health fund:-

- My Q-  to the fund -" I got a printout of the services from the Hospital, it seems a little high. What did the Hospital say when you questioned them" ... Reply "We never question the supplier of the service  .. We sign contracts ( or something of the like !!) and when the bill is presented we pay" .............seems no questions asked .......  OK it may be in line with other hospitals/Doctors but if they keep upping the costs then they will always be in line ..............

Wow!!!! open slather ................................. and the Hospital bill was $1,900 for 1/2 hour operation. I was in  a.m. and out at 1 pm same day ..............then there was the Drs fee and the 'man/woman who puts you to sleep ' ???????????????????????? 

When that RC is finished then one into the Legal Profession. 

Now the chances of those happening is 1 in a 1,000,000,000,000 x power of 10

We as consumers are being ripped off big time IMHO.
