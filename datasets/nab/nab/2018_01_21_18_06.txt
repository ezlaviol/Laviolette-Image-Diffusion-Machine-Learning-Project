The details are vital, but they are different for everyone because everyone has a different balance point. I think that is why sometimes friction develops on the HC threads, because people don't appreciate that other people will have different balance points. 

Just because NAB has had no real capital appreciation over the last few years doesn't mean it's not worth owning any. A 9.5% grossed up yearly return is more than most people achieve chopping and changing between stocks on the ASX. I mean the average person, not the experts on HC of course.
