Also, I agree with 600ml, can you please explain your comments about ANZ and WBC being more digitally able than NAB & CBA.
I have never seen any information that would support those comments, bearing in mind that you will always get individual anecdotes of problems, with many supporters often claiming theirs is the best (or the worst)
Comments I have seen on the various trading platforms (at least) would seem to support the reverse of that assertion, although I would not claim that to be true, so would be interested to see what data this is based on..............
