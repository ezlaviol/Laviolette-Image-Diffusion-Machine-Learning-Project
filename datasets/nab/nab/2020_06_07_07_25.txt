2020-06-07T07:25:00+10:00 : COVID-19 was never predicted though and all share prices have dipped as well as the banks.Getting back to $25 will not take long - maybe $30 will be a longer time coming in the current economic climate.Also, dividend yields will pick up - NAB may give 50 cents in December and increase that as time goes by. NAB is still a great long term investmnet and the way it is now recovering capital value is a testimony to it's longer term value to shareholders.None of us like seeing the value of our portfolios decline so rapidly but - longer term, banks still represent outstanding value.
