2020-05-13T16:35:00+10:00 : This was mentioned in an article about 2hrs before close today:"CBA shares were up 0.1 per cent to $59.77 after it said it would sell a 55 per cent stake in its Colonial First State wealth management unit and made an additional provision of $1.5 billion for the potential longer term impacts of COVID-19."source: https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/downbeat-start-likely-asx-211630012--spt.htmlI'm hoping with the SPP that NAB may look to take more retail $$$ and raise the amount from $500 mil.They may have factored it in already, but given the possibility of restrictions remaining longer than they had envisaged (from their initial projected forecasts) they may look for extra $$$$ from this raise.
