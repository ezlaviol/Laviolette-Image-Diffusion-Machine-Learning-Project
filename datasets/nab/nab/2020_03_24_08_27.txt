2020-03-24T08:27:00+11:00 : I make an typo - 15% not 18%. Better own up to that.. We will see the dividend reduced - 10-20% is the range I am working on..BTW: it has been classifies as  a pandemic - no a China virus.If it gets down to $7-8, I for one, won't be caring too much about the next dividend or the one after that. I'll be liquidating everything and buying as many shares as I can get. I will do so on the understanding that I will quadruple that investment in 12-18 months. So, in a perverse way, I actually hope you are right.

There is no way that dividend level will be held.imoi expect a huge slashing of dividend buy all the banks.And I agree with the last poster, this is more than likely headed well under $10..$7  -$8, quite possibly..This China virus mess ain't going away anytime soon unfortunately.drifta
