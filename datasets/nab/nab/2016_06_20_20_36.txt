2016-06-20T20:36:00+10:00 : Interesting day. It just goes to show how fickle Mrs Market is. That is why trying to apply logic to it can sometimes backfire, badly. All this volatility appears to be related to something that most do not think will happen, might happen . ie Brexit. I am starting to think of Mrs Market as just one big redistributor of wealth. Send some stuff my way Mrs Market .
Sure UK should stay and Clinton should win, but that does not mean either will happen (though I am betting they both will).
Profits in the hand are great, and I certainly agree that as long as you are making money, you can not complain. I will never be able to pick the very top or the very bottom (not enough time or expertise), so all I can hope for is to get somewhere in the vicinity of each. I am still in at this stage, so what next?
US futures are really positive (best I have seen them this year), FTSE is up 2.7%, with the UK banks up to 8% in the green at time of writing (Bank of Scotland). I think it is safe to assume tomorrow looks like green at this stage.
Questions therefore are: will the rally run out of puff by tomorrow, or by Wednesday? I really do not think there is enough time for another sell off, though it could still happen Thursday prior to the referendum. What will happen post referendum? It appears some/many (??) funds are on the sideline waiting for the result. If they decide to enter the market combined with a new financial year soon makes me think there could be really be a big rally coming this way (though I still do not see $30 in the near future, sorry JCoure).
One thing is for sure, it is not going to be boring.
