2020-06-01T10:30:00+10:00 : Get some perspective and calm down... the total number of people in their 30s dead from COVID in Australia is now 1 in about four months of 'deadly pandemic'. Tragic for the man and his family, but I think the nation can bounce back.Around 430 people die every day in Australia from a range of causes... the key difference is we don't tally these by cause and have a hysterical media live reporting each and every one.
