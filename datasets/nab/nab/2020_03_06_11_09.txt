2020-03-06T11:09:00+11:00 : Agreed.Also so much of trading is automated.   Arbitrage, on overseas markets etc.  RBA price cut hardly a surprise, so why fall now (beyond overnight US move).  They all coped okay with the 1.00% to 0.75% cut in terms of net interest margin.  NAB overcooked on Baird news.  Bought in at $22.22.    Good long-term buy.  Coronavirus will be around for a while, but northern hemisphere spring temperatures will end up reducing levels just it does the flu.  Containment efforts useless when its asymptomatic, but this will blow over eventually and people will relax about it.  Human resilience is probably our best and worse trait.  I'm looking for a nice C-suite position if you are interested NAB, just send me a message on here.....
