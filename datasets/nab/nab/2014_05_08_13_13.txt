Angelus,I think you are right about accumulation day.  AFR is quoting CMC dividend 4.18% return.  "Looking at the short term dividend ROI, NAB is likely to pick up the bulk of the dividend switching once ANZ begins trading ex div, CMC says."So on this logic Friday should see another rise in NAB share price as dividend hunters exit ANZ to hold NAB. Well it sounds reasonable but you never know what the agenda really is IMO.
