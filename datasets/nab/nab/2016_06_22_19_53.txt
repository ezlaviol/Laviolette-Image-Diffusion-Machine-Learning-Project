2016-06-22T19:53:00+10:00 : So far so good. No big sell off today. Aus markets steady.
OS markets steady so far. US futures flat.

I am thinking only one more day till UK vote. What can possibly go wrong in one day? Seriously, I doubt there will be massive movement tomorrow. Bookies, according to your chart,  think Bremain rather than Brexit 75% vs 25%.
So assuming Bremain, what will happen Friday/Monday?? Big bounce or anticlimax and nothing?
Of course if Brexit happens I expect I, along with NAB, will be in pain.

As (I think it was) gcteacher said, we are trying to anticipate the not always logical reaction of Mrs Market to an event. This is like playing a combination of monopoly and chess in the same game. Its fabulous.
