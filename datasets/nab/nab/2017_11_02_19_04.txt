2017-11-02T19:04:00+11:00 : The pessimists out there are dreaming.  Today's pullback was no more than that experienced back on 5/10 (and actually less on a % basis).  The SP will be buoyant beyond today and it will be driven more than any simplistic notion of PE or DY, though those parameters alone make it attractive.  The dividend STABILITY will be a very big pull.  Banks are dependable money making machines.  While black swans will always pop up, and the macro will always affect the micro, all you have to really do is smile and wave boys, just smile and wave.  In the long term you will inevitably win.

Take the pre-GFC high.  The stock hit $42.63 before the market collapse.  It is now $31.95.  In that time, however, they paid out $19.09 in divvies ($27.27 if you include franking credits).  The IRR on the straight divvy is 2.5% pa, and 4.8% pa if you can claw back the franking credit.  Inflation over that period was 2.29% pa (CAGR, and, OK, the last quarter's inflation number isn't in there, but its low, so lets not split hairs).

My point is, even if you bought NAB at the worst possible time, at its highest all-time price, you'd still be ahead of inflation and making real money.  Not a lot, but then not a lot bought at that all time price, either.  And the longer you accumulate those divvies, the less important the starting and ending prices get (without being silly about it).  My own NAB shares are returning 11.2% pa, even though my original buy is in the red (DRP magic).

Time in the market, not timing the market, in spite of every stockbroker warning there is no such thing as a "bottom of the drawer share".
