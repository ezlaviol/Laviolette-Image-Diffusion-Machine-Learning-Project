2020-04-14T13:02:00+10:00 : You’re not going to see new lows on the ASX or any other market for that matter. Central banks absolutely have NOT used the last draw card. The fed for example is buying high yield at the moment which is going to prevent most key bankruptcies from happening. We’re yet to do that here.The next move for the fed will be to purchase equities just like the bank of japan has been doing for years now. Not saying it’s good but it’s going to protect the market from new lows. Call it a rigged game or whatever, the point is you better be on the side of the institution issuing trillions in free money. Why fight it? NAB has seen the lows.
