2020-10-27T18:20:00+11:00 : (Adds further details on charges, background on Westpac and NAB) 	Oct 27 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  (ANZ)  said on Tuesday it expects to take an after-tax hit of A$528 million ($376.41 million) to its cash profit in the second half, primarily due to remediation costs. 	The announcement from Australia's fourth-largest bank, just two days before its full-year results are due, reflects continued pressure on bank margins amid record-low interest rates and credit losses due to the pandemic. 	The A$528 million hit to cash profit also includes charges related to changes to the application of its software amortization policy and a write-down of goodwill in ANZ's Pacific business, the bank said.	   	In aggregate, these items would have a 5 basis point impact on its common equity tier-one capital ratio. 	Westpac Banking Corp  (WBC)  has said it would take an $870 million hit to cash earnings in the second half, while National Australia Bank  (NAB)  also warned of an $188 million charge for the same period last week.	 	ANZ will report full-year results on Oct. 29.	 	($1=1.4027 Australian dollars)
