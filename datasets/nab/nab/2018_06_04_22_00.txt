I don't like to try and make firm price predictions on tight time frames because things almost never pan out how you think they will. 

But NAB loves to move between this low $26ish level and the higher $31ish level. Just pull up a chart for the past few yrs & see how many times she has moved up and down between these two ranges.

So I think $29 is highly likely.

Regarding ANZ, I just don't follow them at all so I wouldn't like to take a guess on that one.
