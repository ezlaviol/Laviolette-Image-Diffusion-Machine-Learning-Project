2016-05-19T13:33:00+10:00 : Australian shares slipped 0.6 percent on Thursday, for a second consecutive session, led by losses in energy and mining stocks, while domestic jobs data showed lower-than-expected growth in employment.	 	The S&P/ASX 200 index (xjo) slid 33.66 points to 5,322.50 by 0219 GMT. The benchmark fell 0.7 percent on Wednesday. 	Miners were the biggest losers with BHP Billiton (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) tumbling 4.9 percent and 3.7 percent respectively. Gold miners such as Newcrest (NCM) and Evolution (EVN) slumped more than 7 percent.  	Energy shares were in the red too with Origin (ORG) and Santos (STO) losing more than 4 percent each. 	"(The) gold sector is starting to sell off its recent highs as the gold price in US dollar terms has done virtually nothing over the last 6 weeks," said Mark Lennox, chief executive and client advisor at HC Securities.		"Clients are taking the view that (the) gold price is struggling to find momentum despite the momentum in domestically listed gold plays and as such are removing risk from their portfolios."
