From what I have heard there have been severe side effects in 25% of trial patients - ranging from organ failure to multiple organ dysfunction - that is  a direct quote I read.Not sure that these side effects are not worse than the virus - and would certainly rule it out by the FDA - again, if that feedback is correct.The Chinese would not be trying to nail down the patent as a cure for COVID-19 if these results are true.

We’ve been discussing Remdesivir by Gilead this whole time. The drug the Chinese said was crap meanwhile they were trying to patent it... And at the same time excellent results leaked from the university of Chicago. The first set of official ones are due soon, likely this week.
