This is a crisis and we donâ€™t know the full extent of bank losses, especially once job keeper ends which will show some zombie companies with large debts as well as potentially large unemployment via said zombie companies being put into administration. Have to wait and see, however as we saw before the stock price can whipsaw pretty quickly. Buying under $19 and holding is probably a good strategy unless something severe happens to the economy/second wave. Notwithstanding this quickness of government stimulus should support us which was lessons learnt from the GFC.
