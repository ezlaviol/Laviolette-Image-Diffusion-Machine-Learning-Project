2020-04-23T14:44:00+10:00 : First catalyst might be the financial results starting next week. Note there is probably large selling from Superfunds to fund the $10k per effected person from COVID unemployment or reduced hours. They can’t sell their unlisteds per se, so Australian share market cops a beating for $10s of billions in redemptions. The global holdings can take it, however Superfunds usually have a 40/60 or 50/50 split in FUM for Aus/world shares. Note world shares generally >50% USA, however that’s a highly liquid and large market that can take it.So where can they offload tens of billions on the ASX? Only really the top 20 Asx stocks. Banks, csl, Bhp etc.
