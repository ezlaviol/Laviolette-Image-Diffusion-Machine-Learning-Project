I interpret that as something like this: if they get applns for 40m shrs then they will accept all. Else it will be pro-rated back to holdings on 24th Apr. Furthermore it states that it will be scaled back by whatever method they want to use. Basically, this would mean those who ask for say 500 or less shrs will get their allotment - and for claims over that amount they will be pro-rated.
