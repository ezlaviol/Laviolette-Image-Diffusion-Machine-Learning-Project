2017-05-15T08:41:00+10:00 : The budget  has a 'new' tax  on large  Banks ,which i would think every share holder would have some  ..big/small holding  in,,,,,,, once  up  and running  it opens the door for future  increases when the need arises ,I think this  would have  to be the banks  biggest  concern,,,  not this  first  tax,,  but the  potential	for  more  in the  future ,,,,, remember  once  up and running  hard to get rid off,, this has the potential  to'''' cap '''' bank  future profits ..   any thoughts
