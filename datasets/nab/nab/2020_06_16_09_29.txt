2020-06-16T09:29:00+10:00 : I have no skill in chart reading. I am more of an old school value, cigar butt, investor. For the first time in 33 years, I am just beginning(May 18th) to learn to invest in BNPL(Z1P) and neobank(WZR), new kind of banking. Keep me posted, I am all eyes.By the way, I just heard on Bloomberg Radio that financials were up in the US, and Australian futures are up 2.5% today. Also, if you use CFD, you don't need that much capital for NAB.The magic of crowd information working.
