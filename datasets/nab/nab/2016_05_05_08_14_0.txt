2016-05-05T08:14:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, May 5 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank (NAB), the country's No. 1 lender, on Thursday posted a 6.5 percent rise in first-half cash profit as its wealth business boasted double-digit earnings growth. 	Cash profit for the first six months to end of March rose to A$3.31 billion ($2.47 billion) compared with A$3.1 billion a year ago and analysts' estimate of A$3.35 billion. 	The result comes in a week of forecast lagging performances from No.3 lender Westpac Banking Corp (WBC) and No. 4 ANZ Banking Group (ANZ), confirming the negative trend for the country's banks as they battle a downturn in commodities prices and tougher capital requirements.
