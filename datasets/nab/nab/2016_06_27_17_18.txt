There is nothing NEW in their economy to push it hard one way or the other that isn't known already. Imo  The UK though. Still a basket of vipers over there. CYB down another 9.4% today can't be a good start for them. I thought our markets did exceptionally well to hold were they did. Seeing some popular gold stocks taking a haircut tells me that taking profit is more important than sitting in for the long haul and that reflects the gravity of what has happened, which isn't really that bad. Funny enough the world kept turning today. And all the bargains were in the first few minutes .
