I'll take it as it comes. i just make sure I use small parcels when I start buying in and as the price starts to get to ridiculous levels (if it does) I can take advantage. I wouldn't want to play with a bank stock with less than 200k on a downturn. When it turns (and it always does) I like to be as close to the turn as possible. I don't try and pick the turn, I just start buying when the price gets good. My initial buy of nab was well over $30, which in hindsight was crazy high. To be effective to my average the lower I buy the better. I've seen under $24 so if it gets to 25.50 I'll start with small parcels. This is not only a good price imo but also has a significant effect on my average. Then if it starts knocking on the door of $25 chances are it's going under. Last sell off was to $24.87 iirc so my target would be $24.90. Under that who knows. Would it get to $22? I doubt it but if it did I'd be buying 1k parcels. You can read people here posting negative stuff about Aussie banks all you like. But you see in a lot of them they talk about the banks leading the charge or leading the retreat. It's because the banks are the banks. They have the money, they have the drive to make even more money. They don't make as much as a lot of the penny stocks overnight, but they make a whole lot more than the penny stocks over time.
