2020-03-14T15:34:00+11:00 : anyone reckon technology influences this though? I wasn’t buying stocks in 2008 but imagine it wasn’t anywhere near as easy to monitor and buy them.But hoping things do go further though as you suggest to buy some other blue chips that didn’t get hit as hard as the banks last week.Anyway, entered NAB yesterday with a small parcel at 16.05. This was the target I had set and was very surprised it hit these ‘GFC like’ levels so quick. Happy to hold for a few years. Whats your target out of interest?
