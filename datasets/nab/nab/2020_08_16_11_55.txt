Great leadership means you stand by your people's underwriting abilities regardless of current economic pain. Worse is throwing your customers under the bus by making that comment. Generalist "urging" never bodes well without taking into account the customers individual circumstances. Everyone in the industry knows this obviously not the head honcho. Your days at RBS would have given you insights into how Scottish properties recovered after the GFC collapse. Focus on a vision for the future rather than making panic driven comments like "sell now" which is obviously driven by your aim of reducing impairments.
