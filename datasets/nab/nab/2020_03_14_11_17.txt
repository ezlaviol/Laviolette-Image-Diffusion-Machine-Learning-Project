2020-03-14T11:17:00+11:00 : Any body wishing (hoping) big 4 banks will go bankrupt, is day dreaming...Aussie Banks (NAB ANZ WBC & CBA)  are sitting on healthy trading margin of 1.75%. They may take some hit on profit due to lower business activities but all top 4 are highly profitable right now...However, NAB is largest business lender and that is where NAB faces a big danger during March quarter... As some of small business will struggle to pay rent when shops are empty, it will hurt bank transactions fee's revenue very hard.
