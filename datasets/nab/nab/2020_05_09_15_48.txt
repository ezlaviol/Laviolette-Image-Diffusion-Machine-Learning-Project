2020-05-09T15:48:00+10:00 : To those shareholders that are concerned about a scale back in the spp, did you know:-Westpac spp Dec 2019 was oversubscribed and not scaled back. And 7% shareholder participation rate.- CBA 2009 spp was not scaled back, and it's assumed there was only 15% shareholder participation rate.- ANZ 2009 spp was not scaled back, oversubscribed by almost $2bill and they accepted the lot, 40% participation rate.- BOQ 2009 spp was oversubscribed and not scaled back. More recently during the current crisis:- Nextdc spp last month, no scale back - Cochlear spp last month, oversubscribed, retail amount increased by x4, 41% scale back, 45% participation rate and the share price was trading at about 30% higher during the spp application period. yes the 2009 NAB spp was scaled back unfairly to retail investors but history shows the majority of bank spp's accepted their oversubscriptions.  I'm also guessing there are more shareholders on jobkeeper allowance (lacking $) now than during the past spp's...So there should be low shareholder participation which should reduce the amount oversubscribed.
