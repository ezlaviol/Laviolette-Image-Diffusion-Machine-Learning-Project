2020-04-28T09:52:00+10:00 : I absolutely agree that SPP's provide an opportunity in banks, with NAB being the exception. Without going into fine detail, I'm sure many long-time holders can agree that this is the "cursed" bank. Mismanaged on wealth integration; mismanaged on risk; mismanaged on capital management; mismanaged on expenses. Whatever dividends you earned from the bank has likely been more than offset by capital losses. How embarrassing that its share price hit 1996 lows in March, while CBA is only back where it was several years ago. How could the Clyne and Thorburn-era management not see that an 80-100% dividend payout ratio was not sustainable? They put the metal on the pedal and jumped out of the car before it inevitably crashed into a tree - which happened to be COVID this time (it would be something else anyway).In my opinion, if you're a bank investor you want quality and NAB will never fit into that category because it's structurally poorly managed. I'd advocate investors look at CBA, Macquarie, the capital-rich Canadian banks and profitable beasts like JPMorgan. NAB is like the very bad girlfriend or boyfriend who will only constantly disappoint you no matter how much patience you give him/her, but it's a shame that most holders still can't see it because they're so in love with its dividend. Disclosure: I dumped all my stock at $24 for a small gain driven really only by franking credits.
