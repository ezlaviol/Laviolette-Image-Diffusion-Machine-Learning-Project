2020-03-14T09:47:00+11:00 : It's caused 2 circuit breakers in a week to trigger. The biggest one day drop since 1987. The fastest 2 week decline. So I'd say 50/50 no-one knows. Because this is a virus and not the GFC I said in another forum how do you put a stop on a virus? GFC is another story. The gov pull all the banks in line pump some stimulus and market starts to turn.. how do you do that to a virus induced best market. Who knows maybe it will dissapear like how sars did out of the blue.
