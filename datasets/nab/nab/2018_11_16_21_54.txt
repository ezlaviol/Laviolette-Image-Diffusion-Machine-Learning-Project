2018-11-16T21:54:00+11:00 : One good eg would be the NABTrade High-Interest Account, also known as the HIA.

It gives-out 2.15% per annum calculated on a daily basis and banked-into the account at month-end. NO locked-out period, can be withdrawn at any time.

Do you have another please ? Would appreciate if you can share if you have an account with higher interest out there....
