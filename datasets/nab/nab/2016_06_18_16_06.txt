2016-06-18T16:06:00+10:00 : You are correct: My mistake regarding an upcoming NAB divvy - I saw the Divvy Notice on the NAB board today and failed to realise that this is referring to Sept 1st divvy for NABPB.

Apologies for those incorrect comments. If the NAB divvy holds firm around 99c the share price should hold up a little better than my previous comments suggest... However I'm still very cautious here as banks seem out of favour.
