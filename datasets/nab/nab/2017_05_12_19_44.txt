Continuing to believe in and support a failing system that puts lying, deceptive, self-serving politicians in control of the well-being of the country and your own future financial well-being is a cop-out. Particularly after voluminous empirical evidence has proven the destructive and selfish nature of politicians to you over a significant period of time. It also isn't very bright. It is a cop-out to simply vote and thereby think you are performing some noble act which makes any material difference and in that allow yourself to feel some sense of self-satisfaction. Get involved in changing the system if you truly don't want to cop-out.
