2018-05-30T13:57:00+10:00 : CBA keeps testing out buying support around $69, the selling into that support will not subside any time soon and it will break.

 CBA has not been below this point since 2013 so once she slips below $69 she heads to $65 as first stop.

This will rock market confidence in the banks, NAB will follow suit. Once CBA breaks below $69 it takes NAB below $26.

I wouldn't touch the banks with a barge pole just yet unless shorting.
