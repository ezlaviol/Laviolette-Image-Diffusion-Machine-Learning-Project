2018-03-04T23:39:00+11:00 : From my simplistic monthly chart based analysis, NAB is in a downtrend, but I think it will first go up to 31.5+- 20c before going down....so, am holding to the stock I had bought some time  ago at 30.46, when I thought it had started an uptrend.......keeping fingers crossed
