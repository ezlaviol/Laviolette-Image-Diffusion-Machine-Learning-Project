But I love Aussie banks so I'm kind of planning to be in the run up somewhere. Just scraped into $29 pre last div on maintaining 99c. Economic climate isn't actually better than it was then and neither is sentiment. So if you see $30 then I'll be very happy for you since I'll probably be holding at the time as well.
