Re NAB, out of all the four, it has the most recovery to go by any measure, short of falling behind further which under the Four Pillar policy, it cannot really do, it has sold CYB, got rid of MLC, does not have the insurance, wealth and pension fund problems of the others esp. CBA.

Do you really think Drumpf will win? I suspect Goldman Sachs, Wall Street and Hillary Clinton may have some more firepower than those lame duck Republicans did. Little Marco and Canadian Cruz were two of the worst candidates in GOP history, almost as has as NAB's recent CEOs.

Clinton must be almost as certain as Johnson 1964 to become President. In fact, Hillary cut her teeth in the 64 campaign for the GOP, for Goldwater, the previously worst candidate in GOP history. True, look it up if you doubt, Hillary switched from GOP to Democrat due to Vietnam opposition. Funny, as Nuxon and GOP ended Vietnam whereas Kennedy and Johnson beat it up and prolonged it. Trump would neither be better or worse for Wall Street but he will not win in any event.
