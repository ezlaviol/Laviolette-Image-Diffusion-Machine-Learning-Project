2015-12-11T17:06:00+11:00 : Here's an update on the daily and weekly charts using the same metrics as before. NAB has continued its downtrend this week drifting lower on very light volume (2nd lowest weekly volume in the past 52 weeks and 4th lowest in the past 3 years)

MACD histogram on the weekly is slightly negative, almost unchanged from previous week but it is using a very short period (5) to increase sensitivity on the weekly.

Daily:




Weekly:



FA points: The CYBG float document was released this week, next week the dividend is paid so NAB will no longer be trading XD. Will it kick up after that?

I added to my holding on Thursday using the fall to accumulate.

*shrug* DYOR happy to hear comments on the above analysis too
