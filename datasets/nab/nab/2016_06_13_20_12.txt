On the bank front, there was something troubling me all day. There was a final signal to buy that was missing. I could not bring it up because talking about could alter the outcome. And then it came tonight. Lurkin saying don't buy banks. If Nanood's theory is correct, then time to buy banks is now. (sorry Lurkin; I really appreciate your posts).

Good luck to all.....
