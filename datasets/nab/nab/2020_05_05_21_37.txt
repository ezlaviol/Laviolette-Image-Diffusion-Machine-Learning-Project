2020-05-05T21:37:00+10:00 : In 2009, ANZ had 178000 retail shareholders (40%) apply for the spp.  The bank accepted all applications and issued $2.2billion of equity....in addition to the $2.5billion institution placement.  The original figure was for only $350 million to retail , and anything more was subject to scale back...but they took everything they received...$2.2billion which is a similar amount allocated to institutions. So NAB might accept a lot more than $500mill from retail applications.  $3billion is allocated to institutions.If 40% of the 570000 retail shareholders apply for on average $15k, = $3.4 billion which is a similar amount allocated to institutions.....not all applications will be for the $30k.Last month's cochlear spp amount for retail shareholders was increased by x4.NAB scaled back their 2009 spp but they may accept a whole lot more this time in my opinion.
