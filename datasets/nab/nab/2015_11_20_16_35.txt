2015-11-20T16:35:00+11:00 : Yeah DRP price announced at 28.48.

My break even is a bit higher at $34.57. I 'overpaid' when setting up my position around mid $35's back in early 2014 and smaller parcel around 32 along with the DRP and SPP has been bringing it down since. 

Long term so not bothered, +10 years investment horizon. I was considering adding here to bring it down further as I am rebalancing. In hindsight it would have been great to take the cash div and snap up a bunch in the $27's when it went ex-div. Hindsight aye.
