2020-05-27T20:09:00+10:00 : It's in the announcement. There will be 88 million new shares representing 2.8% ordinary shares on issue. The previous trench was more than twice this one, I think someone did a calculation in this thread showing something like ~8% dilution. That'd be around ~AU$1.4 per share dilution.I'm frankly more concerned about the CFO and media team who couldn't announce the numbers properly than the dilution .
