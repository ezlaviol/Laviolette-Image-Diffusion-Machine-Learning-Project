2020-05-01T17:06:00+10:00 : There is no point in holding banks when interest rates are at or near the zero bound. Say goodbye to those 5% divvies because they are long gone. Franking credits will probably disappear when the politicos realise they have to get money from somewhere other than dwindling income taxes.Interest rates will stay low for the foreseeable future because there is pretty much no scope for hiking.  Banks won't be able to lever their meagre ROE to anything substantial cos of capital reserve requirements which will only become more stringent in the current climate. I don't think we have reached the bottom in financials yet. There is a negative divergence away from the broader market and other sectors which underscores the quagmire in which the Big Banks currently find themselves in (this is the BetaShares Aus Financials ETF which is pretty much the banks): Not to mention the share price has been lacklustre long before this crisis even hit: On top of that, investor sentiment is pretty negative at the moment, to say the least.There's some pretty pissed off fundies out there. No doubt some of them rage quit the stock today........happy investing all TBH I'd rather hold a sizeable chunk in cash than buy these banks in deflationary environments like this.
