2019-03-06T17:38:00+11:00 : Couldn't agree more with you...Decade after decade the Libs/Nats and Labor (both State and Fed) have been stuffing the country while lining their own pockets and their mates pockets.. jobs for the boys etc. etc. and we have these debates about Libs/Nats and Labor for what!  Nothing ever changes!  Nothing is ever fixed.. how can it be when at every election we are voting about the same issues from the last election and the one before that..Lib/Nats and Labor are like Coles and Woolies!  Nothing really different!  They just have different branding!  Same stuff in the 'store'If we vote for more Independents we can disrupt this decay of our political system(s) that we have been putting up with for years..Political disruption is what this country needs!  We don't even have the 'Australian Democrats' anymore!  And the 'Greens' are useless as we all know!Vote Different this year.. the NSW State Election very soon and the Federal Election.. let's send a message that we don't want corrupt political parties and corporate lobby groups, running our lives!  We want real people, with real life experience who aren't 'Professional Politicians'Look at Chris Pyne, entered at the age of 25!  No real life experience, no job experience!We've got to change our culture of voting Lib/Nat or Labor.. just because!  Just because it's what we've always done!  Just because our parents or friends do.. or the suburb we live or grew up in...  We need to think differently, think outside the box!Vote Independent!  Vote Different!  Vote for Real People that can make our lives and our children's lives better for the future!BTW:  No, I'm not a candidate for any election, I'm just sick of the dribble and crap we get from the people who are supposed to be representing us!
