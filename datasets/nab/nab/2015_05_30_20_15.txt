2015-05-30T20:15:00+10:00 : Following NAB's demerger from the Clydesdale bank will NAB shareholders receive shares in Clydesdale bank?

If so at what ratio? Eg 1:1 NAB / Clydesdale

Also what date is it due to happen?

Sorry if this seems a silly question but I am just a novice blue chip trader!

Thanks in advance.
