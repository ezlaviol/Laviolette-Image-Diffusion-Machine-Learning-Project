Look at cryptocurrencies, look at Elon Musk's vision for Paypal (what Square is doing). If banks are complacent like the big automakers have been towards electric cars, it will be a messy and painful transition imo.I'm not saying banks are going anywhere; they are the glue that holds our whole system together. There's just a lot of risks coming over the next decade they need to prepare for.
