2016-07-27T09:44:00+10:00 : I wouldn't expect too much of a run in Boq yet. October is usually a good month (ex). Sharp eyes on cba. Div is usually priced in by the time it reaches ex date. You just have to decide to stay or go.  Usually I would look at the sp, minus the div then look at the sp and decide whether or not that price is a price I would buy the stock at. If I think it's overvalued I'm out. But if catastrophic struck and cba was $68 on ex date then I'd be taking the div and holding on. Anyway, if yr average is 76 and we get to 80 then yr ahead on both. At 78 then really it's all about whether you want the stock or you want the money in the bank because in that scenario yr going to come out about even. Only benefit is the franked credits. Ahh well, I'm sure you have a plan in mind
