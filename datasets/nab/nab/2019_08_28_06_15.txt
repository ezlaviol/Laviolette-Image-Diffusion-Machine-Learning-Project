2019-08-28T06:15:00+10:00 : Dow down 125 points though mainly on a few US companies not making profit targets and not on international trade woes sentiment.Be interesting to see if yesterdays SP momentum can be maintained and not suffer from the DOW's downturn.NAB should be $28 at the moment and maybe nearer the $30 mark by the end of the year. Just needs a good week or two. It has proven to be remarkably resilient when compared to the 3 other big 4 banks this year.
