2020-06-04T10:22:00+10:00 : Bloody hell, I cry not fair .... I held 3,000 before the spp, applied for $30,000 worth, received 838 shares costing $11857.70, leaving them having the use of my $18,142.30 for weeks interest free ........... bastards!  (and what really irritates is I sold a couple of thousand WBC at $15.80 to raise the funds, what are they today $18+)
