That is a roughly 18% gross return pa, with arguably little risk. Any gain you can manage on trading the dips would be on top. It certainly is food for thought. 

The whole thing however depends on being able to watch the moving numbers and having the time and ability to pick appropriate entry points, and you know how itchy my trigger finger gets...... 
As a consequence my entry point has been suboptimal and hampered by Brexit, which affects any potential exit. But, if the banks continue to rise over I can close positions post dividends and reset looking for a lower entry point (I may have to sit on my hands or disconnect the keyboard ).
