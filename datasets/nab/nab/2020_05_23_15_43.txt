2020-05-23T15:43:00+10:00 : i do think that the banks will drift down for at least the remainder of the year and quite possibly into the first half of next year..  Simply because at the moment there are countless unviable companies and investment vehicles being supported by reduced rents , loan repayment holidays, jobkeeper etc . They will take a while to come out in the wash.  but Im not the only one who has the same thoughtsQuote AFR 28 April 2020 "Banking analysts fear that if the COVID-19 crisis worsens, the cost to the big four banks of bankrolling "Team Australia" could exceed the $10 billion estimated for this year and $35 billion over three years."AND THIS NAB exposure to Commercial Real Estate right now ... and we are now seeing signs that perhaps we dont need as much office space as we used to ......Courtesy of Mbank ResearchThe numbers above are $Billions !

But that is just my opinion.  a
