2020-06-14T08:44:00+10:00 : No. 5 most traded. As UBS’s top-rated banking analyst, Jon Mott, has recently highlighted, on a price-to-book value basis ANZ, NAB and Westpac shares have been at their cheapest levels since 1993. And if you believe (as I do) that the housing market is poised to recover and that Australia’s rapid exit from containment will ensure loan losses will be no worse than what the banks have already provisioned for, there is a credible case for their returns on equity to climb back to and above the banks’ cost of equity. This implies that they should be trading at or above book value, which is why I am a buyer right now.
