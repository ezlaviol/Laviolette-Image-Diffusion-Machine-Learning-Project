If Labor do change the Franking system....................wow what damage will it do to the ordinary Super Funds ... and what damage to their voters $$$$ ... but then would their voters understand the possible implications ... going forward ???  I think the Shadow Treasurer has about as much understanding of finance than most newts-- apologies to newts !!   All IMHO been wrong before .. many times.

Me think Not !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
