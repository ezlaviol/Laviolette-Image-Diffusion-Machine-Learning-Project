2022-08-11T08:10:00+10:00 : Well posted, again confirms if needed, as to how investors are mesmerised by bank results with a lot of trailing zeros and instantly just to the conclusion, wow are those banks doing well for retail sh's.  Smoke and mirrors trick has succeeded, as most of the banks are not doing well.  NAB in particular, ground hog day, same dreary results announced, same excuses, 1970's bankers, no change in culture, no meaningful reforms, backward systems and on it goes. Instead of declining results, should be booming, at a time when the economy is really performing but as always  the banks will do the same, blame anyone and anything, promise the world and deliver much less than an atlas.
