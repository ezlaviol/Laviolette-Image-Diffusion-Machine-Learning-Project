2015-11-05T14:01:00+11:00 : NAB May Be Australia's Best-Placed Bank: StocksInValue -- Market Talk

0127 GMT [Dow Jones] National Australia Bank (NAB.AU) is unlikely to escape an expected sector-wide increase in bad debt, but it still looks like one of the most profitable lenders on the Australian stockmarket, says Jonathan Wilson, an analyst at StocksInValue, a subsidiary of Clime Asset Management. "Our view is NAB is the best-placed major bank in the increasingly challenging Australian banking environment," says Wilson. While the bank said in its FY15 report that loan impairment expenses fell to 0.16% of total loans, this trend is set to reverse in coming results, which could dampen earnings, says Wilson. Still, he believes the lender's near-term credit quality is well shielded by improved debt-servicing capacity from lower lending rates, low corporate gearing and support for asset prices from global liquidity.
"For now we think NAB should achieve mid-single digit earnings growth consistent with below-trend economic growth and benign credit quality conditions." NAB was last trading 4.5% lower at A$28.58 Thursday.([emailÂ protected]; Twitter: @verasydney)
