2016-04-04T11:42:00+10:00 : I rang an investor mate before mkt open and asked what he thought re NAB. He and I are both fairly cashed-up and wary of a crash. We use stocksinvalue to give us an IV to work off and they have current IV at $33.69 ie 30.8% above friday's close. But they drop the FY17 IV to $30.43 before increasing it for FY18. SinV is very conservative and it was enough to prompt me to buy at today's open @ $25.75. Just a modest parcel and will wait and see. HY only one month away. 

Anyone else buying today?
