I told him that the downside to this was that their dividend could be cut and the share price collapse. This was no arbitrage opportunity i.e. free money pump without risk.  Needless to say it worked out for him and he made his paltry differential sans much capital growth that I know of. However, since then EPS has been rather flat and annual dividends per share stuck on $1.98. NAB has gone nowhere fast hence the doldrums. The advertising is all about retaining market share in a mature savagely competitive market. I still reckon NAB are worth holding onto owing to the high dividend yield in a sustained deflationary environment and lowish risk (if nothing else).
