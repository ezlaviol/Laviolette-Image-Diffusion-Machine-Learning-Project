2020-03-07T14:16:00+11:00 : Actually, MissG, I sold 80% of my holdings at $29 and the remaining portion at $27.I would appreciate you not labelling me a liar - I don't do that to you or anyone else. My respect for you just took a nose dive. You need to apologise - it's OK, I know you won't.In reply to a post not long after I did that post informed me that you never kept shares and sold them on the high and did not collect dividends. I recall I replied to that e-mail saying it was a good idea.  I sold very soon after that as I was well in profit territory.

Your full of it , we know you didnt sell at 29 you liar , you were betting the Ex div would recover in days  , thats not the statement of a person who just sold . Consider yourself exposed  ...
