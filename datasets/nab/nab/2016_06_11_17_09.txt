For me and my needs I prefer NAB. On a banking service level I think they are the best of the big four and have treated me very well with respect to financing/banking. I find them quite progressive for a big bank. As a consequence I think they are best positioned to weather financial storms. Having said it doesn't mean that because I like their style of banking, Mrs Market will value NAB better. 

NAB has also returned better dividends in the past, approaching 11% at current dividends after franking credits are taken into account on the current SP (at SP of $25.71 it would be 11% exactly).

Ultimately they are both very similar. I think the most important aspect when taking a position is the entry price, unless you have a very long, eg 20 years, timeframe. It's so much easier to make a profit when you have bought well, than to try and compensate a bad entry point by needing to sell high. 

So, for me, at Friday's prices it would have been NAB. In the short term personally I doubt I would say no to NAB below $25.5 and ANZ below $23.5 but I would start small. Keep some ammo left in case it goes against you. NAB below $24 and ANZ below $22 currently would be a different matter (back up the truck). NAB/ANZ below $10 the end is near so arm yourself and run for the hills.

Remember everyone is different so what works for me may not be in your best interest so DYOR.

Good luck, and gamble responsibly .
