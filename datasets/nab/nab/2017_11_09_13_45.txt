2017-11-09T13:45:00+11:00 : Australian shares extended their rally to hit a near 10-year high on Thursday, underscored by gains in material stocks and  as investors bought on technical signals. 	The S&P/ASX 200 index (xjo) was up 0.2 percent, or 13.44 points to 6,029.70 by 0034 GMT. The benchmark closed up 0.03 percent on Wednesday.

"We've manage to maintain ground above it (the 6,000 level) and that's giving a technical signal to investors that the index is moving into a new higher range," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.

The financial index .AXFJ was down marginally as National Australia Bank (NAB), one of the "Big Four" banks, traded ex-dividend on the day, falling as much as 3.9 percent. 	"If NAB wasn't ex-dividend, the index would be 10 points higher and the financial sector will be up there leading the market as well," McCarthy of CMC Markets said.
