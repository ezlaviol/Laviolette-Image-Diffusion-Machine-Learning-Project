2018-02-09T10:30:00+11:00 : US/Global markets are highly volatile at the moment and word is that we may not have seen the overall Dow lows yet for 2018 given the very high volume of selling right towards the Dow close (big bearish red candle closed pretty much  on it's lows last night).... so what will happen tonight?  perhaps another 500-1000 point drop? risky times trying to trade in these volatile markets.....
