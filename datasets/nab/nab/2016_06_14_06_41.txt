2016-06-14T06:41:00+10:00 : Should be a break into 25 today . Might be hard to resist a small parcel if it gets to 25.5 but 50c+ drop is a big ask on top of Friday.
Cba prolly get hit hardest as usual @gcteacher and repay you for that bullish sentiment . Like to see ANZ into the 23 but no idea if it will hold. Ben will be the most interesting. Shorted hard + a bad day.. Wonder how that's gonna go. Hopefully down down down. Wife has us organised for walks through a national Forrest. Will be serious danger of falling over and hurting myself watching the phone all day. I better prepare to get spoken too harshly
