In the meantime I will just hatch them, though the incubation period may be quite long . I normally hold a few and trade a few. You don't make as much, but if you get it wrong, you don't lose as much.

Anyway, I can now average down, and with that initial price you would think that should currently not be too hard, even for me. It keeps things interesting.
