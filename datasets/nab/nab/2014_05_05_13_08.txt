512lLibs will be cutting spending in the  upcoming budget .Where and by how much?The persistent threats has IMO resulted in a lack of confidence and short term downside risk for financial stocks. What will happen after the budget?After the budget is announced and leading up to the div I am hoping  Nabs sp will continue to rise.However questiions are now being asked questioning the competence of the libs and the extent of the debt that the labour govt has put us into.Hoping the budget will not be too severe and nabs sp will rise.Stackey
