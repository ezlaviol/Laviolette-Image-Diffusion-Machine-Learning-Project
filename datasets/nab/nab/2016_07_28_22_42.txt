That's now 23k shares by my count Nanood. You have been busy.  I think at the moment it's the best value out of the banks.  I hope you do well. Not sure it will get much lower though, but you never know your luck. 

Yes pls jumped up, but so did all its siblings. It is a long way off from its recent high too. On a bright note, I bought more at 60 and 56 as it fell, before I ran out of pls money and courage so, once it gets above 56 I will be ahead on my last parcel! 

I have just got some more pocket money (could have used it yesterday when pls hit 43 ï¿¼but such is life ). Let's see what is around . I think we agreed BOQ looks good. Trouble is I am hoping one of my "tragics" is about to fly and I am thinking of wasting some more money on it. Decisions,  decisions.
