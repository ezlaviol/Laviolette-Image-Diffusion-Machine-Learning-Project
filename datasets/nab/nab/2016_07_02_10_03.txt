2016-07-02T10:03:00+10:00 : Probably not a bad idea to have something else to look at. GL with PLS, hopefully that's a cracker for you and holders. ANZ back into 23, nice sale on BEN, that should keep going imo. As I've stated my reserve of buying just yet is the cba results but I'm planning on being heavily committed in the lead up to divs. August results for BEN on the 8th, CBA the 10th & BOQ the 31. I think the run on BEN is because the results are close and will continue. CBA has passed if you wanted to get out on ex date and claim franked but might have a run up to the 10th Aug. BOQ better rally hard soon or I'll have to eat cake. NAB to float around for a while imo and be + or - affected by other results. Then another 3 months to get nab results. World events can always have an impact but they will get talked about if or when they happen.

Div on Tuesday and the wife already has it spent 

Did a pre vote a couple days ago so no polling station sausage sizzle for me!

PLS announce on Tue? If so that's twice as good a day for you!
