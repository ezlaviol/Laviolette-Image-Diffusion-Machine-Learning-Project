2020-04-30T20:35:00+10:00 : I made a post about that SPP recently. I was a young pup at the time and remember me and the old man (who held many more shares than me) put in for the full allocation, we both got scaled back to the same amount of shares. Anyway will be happy to buy more at $14.15. Cheers
