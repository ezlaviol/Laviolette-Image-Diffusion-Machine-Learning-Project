2020-07-27T13:33:00+10:00 : nabs current long term share price since 1998 looks very much inline it's at its bottom waiting for a medium term uptrend. I think 25 - 28 medium term, 20-22 short term if bottom is in. covid is key to how long this plays out. cos the world is working their arse off to fix covid I'm not terribly concerned as long as government is throwing money at people and fining then like there's tomorrow. it keeps everyone on their toes for a vaccine and a speedy recovery. if no vaccine masks and surgical gloves will just become the norm in society.
