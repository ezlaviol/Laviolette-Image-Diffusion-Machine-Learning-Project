2023-05-04T11:12:00+10:00 : Might be slightly under consensus but figures show a very strong result. Good volume and earnings growth and dividend back to 2019 1hy level.I didn't bother checking but guarantee it will be on a much more conservative payout ratio of around 65% which continues to ensure balance sheet strength.Of course market won't like impairment charges up (which will be reflected in all the banks) although book still looks pretty strong. Narrative about future competitive pressures and NIM also keep a lid on prospects but overall selling looks way over done, nothing unusual there
