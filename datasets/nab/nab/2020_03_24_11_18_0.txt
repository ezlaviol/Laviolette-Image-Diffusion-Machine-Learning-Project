2020-03-24T11:18:00+11:00 : The real unemployment level in Australia is considered to be one and a half times the official rate - and includes the "underemployed" Most of whom are casuals and are now considered unemployed. The unemployment figures here will include the underemployed and those who are not working but have not registered previously. Our unemployment rate will get to 8-10% in the next 4 weeks.

The rise in unemployment applications in USA the past week are scarily massive. No doubt the same here. I am not sure the market is factoring how bad it is going to get in the next few months.
