Quick question, how do you work out how much it should go down on ex-div date inc franking credits?

I always thought it was as simple as thinking it tends to go down the same amount of the Div amount which in this case is 99c but I've recently learnt that this is not the case as it usually goes down more to include the "franking credits" or something.

I'll be the first to admit I have no idea what this actually means but I'd appreciate it if someone can explain this to me so I can then understand how to calculate roughly what I think it should go down etc.

Also yes I know this is not always the case but just to use this as one as an example if anyone can explain it that'd be great.

Thanks

PS - I sold out today at my buyin price as silly me didn't know it was going ex-div on Tuesday so I plan to rebuy on Tuesday.
