At a share price of $30 and around a $2 dividend yield is 6.5% and 9.5% if you can use the franking credit. Also expecting MLC to be sold or demerged in the next 12 months so likely more value in our pockets. Why wouldn't the share price go higher with interest rates so low. Where else can you get that sort of return on your investment dollar. Just returning to a fair value after the embarrassment of the RC.
