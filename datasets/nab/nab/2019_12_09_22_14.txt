2019-12-09T22:14:00+11:00 : Total annual return on NAB since last time it was around 25 at end of 2000 is 9%. Annual total return on STW (oldest ASX ETF; ASX200) since inception (end of 2001) is around 8.3%.





Sure NAB is no CSL, but you could do a lot worse than buying and holding over the last 20 years. I bet a lot of people have done worse in fact, seeing as most, including the "pros", can not beat the index.
