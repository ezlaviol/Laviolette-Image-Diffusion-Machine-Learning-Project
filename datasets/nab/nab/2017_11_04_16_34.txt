The strategy seems very poor IMHO, that stood out for me, digital and technology mentioned but no strategy to achieve it, no comments on improving portfolio exposures, lending, operations and the risk of their geography. Pretty poor IMHO but pls DYOR.

U canâ€™t cut costs to get growth. In fact growth falls if the cuts are too deep and they look a bit too deep to me. Market seems to agree IMHO although it had a small dead cat on Friday, I guess.
