2018-11-16T19:36:00+11:00 : Too many cross-currents in the world at this time,...better to just collect the dpu and stay on the sidelines. Many who went in and bought when the price fell earlier regretted it later for catching a falling knife.

Ironically, they did not learn their lesson, and they went in again and caught the knife the second time when the price fell further.

I caught the knife ONCE ! (smile)

Just go do other things for now and read the news for pleasure. Put your cash into a high-yield account for now.
