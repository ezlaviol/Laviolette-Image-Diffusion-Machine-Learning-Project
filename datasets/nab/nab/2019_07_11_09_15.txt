2019-07-11T09:15:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, July 11 (Reuters) - Australia's prudential regulator said on Thursday it has told three of the country's biggest banks to set aside an additional A$500 million ($348 million) each until they have strengthened risk management and reimbursed customers wrongly charged fees. 	The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said it wrote to Westpac Banking Corp  (WBC) , Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  (ANZ)  and National Australia Bank Ltd  (NAB)  to tell them of additional capital requirements.  	"Australia's major banks are well-capitalised and financially sound, but improvements in the management of non-financial risks are needed," APRA Chair Wayne Byres said in a statement.
