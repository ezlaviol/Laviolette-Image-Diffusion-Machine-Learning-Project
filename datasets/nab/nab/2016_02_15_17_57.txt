2016-02-15T17:57:00+11:00 : Foreign "off the plan" developments unaffected by  crackdown  Boom is focusing on city of Brisbane  Land values soaring  	A loophole in Australian property  rules has helped overseas developers invest what industry  executives believe were record levels in the country in 2015,  casting doubt over the efficacy of curbs intended to keep a lid  on soaring prices.  	Newly built properties are exempt from rules on existing  homes that restrict sales to foreigners, creating an opportunity  for overseas investors to get into one of the world's fastest  growing housing markets.  	That has left a thorny problem for Australia, grappling with  the politically sensitive issue of unaffordable homes and a  surge of cash from wealthy Chinese that has prompted regulators  to consider tighter anti-money laundering rules.		A Reuters review of the last 20 Foreign Investment Review  Board annual reports shows foreign-financed residential "off the  plan" construction approvals hit a record total value of A$16.4  billion ($11.6 billion) in 2014, triple the previous year.  	Analysts and industry players expect that 2015 will turn up  an even higher number. Official data is released in April.  	In an indication of demand, National Australia Bank Ltd   (NAB)  has extended its largest Islamic financing to date for  a A$160 million real estate purchase in Brisbane by  Singapore-based firm AEP Investment Management (AEPiM), part of  Saudi Arabian conglomerate Al Rajhi Holding Group.		TH Properties Sdn Bhd, the real estate arm of Malaysia's  pilgrims fund Tabung Haji, completed a A$220 million Sydney  development in November.  	Chinese buyers are also key, fuelling demand for companies  like Land & Homes  (LHM) , which had its market debut last  month, becoming the first listed developer to target  predominantly overseas buyers.  	"The mainland Chinese (want) to come to Australia for  education and generally they are buying a residence so the  family can come over and stay," said Choon Keng Kho, a director  of Land & Homes. "We can incorporate what they need into the  design and, secondly, when dealing with them."  	Land & Homes paid A$21.3 million for a four-floor government  building in Australia's No.3 city Brisbane, which it plans to  convert into a 30-storey, 389-apartment tower.			HEADING NORTH	  Australia's two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, have  seen double-digit price rises in recent years. Big Asian  investors like Land & Homes are now turning their attention to  Brisbane, left relatively unaffected as a stalling economy kept  land values in check.  	That city's economy has since rebounded, attracting buyers  to a subtropical city of 2 million people about 1,000 km (620  miles) closer to Asia than Sydney. As a result, from 2013 to  2014, the average land value of residential development sites in  Brisbane doubled.  	The average value of offshore-originating development site  purchases quadrupled while purchases from Australian developers  were flat, according to agent CBRE.  	"The entry of some of these participants has been pretty  aggressive," said Mark Steinert, CEO of Australian developer  Stockland Corp., which in 2015 bought a stake in two  locally-owned Brisbane residential tower projects but otherwise  has limited exposure to apartments.  	"Whether they make adequate profits or not, time will tell,  but from a customer point of view, one would anticipate that it  means more supply and therefore good opportunities."  	Guangzhou R&F Properties Co Ltd  2777.HK  in 2015 paid  Brisbane-based Metro Property Development A$46 million for a  site for which that group paid A$24 million six months earlier.  	World Class Land, owned by Singapore conglomerate Aspial  Corp  ASPA.SI , paid Australian developer Cornerstone A$36  million for a Brisbane apartment site, more than double what  Cornerstone paid Metro in 2013.
