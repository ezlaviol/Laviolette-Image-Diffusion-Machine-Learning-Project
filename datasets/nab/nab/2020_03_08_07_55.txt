2020-03-08T07:55:00+11:00 : The 2008 GFC isnt even on that chart?The GFC got down to $17. But very briefly and hovering at $22 in the main.I suspect countries will see Chinas quarantine sanction clamp down didnt do much to contain the disease as much it just did to suppress it. Business as usual (minus school closures) will probably result in Australia much like Italys outcome but that wont go on forever, if at all, for obvious reasons.People will bore of the headlines. Yet continue on with life taking added protection. COVID19 will just become the new flu. with the elderly removing themselves from public places far more than the main. Not that the elderly dont do that anyway and it doesnt ill effect the economy. They will await the vaccine while the world goes on.NABs business sector continues to operate as it needs to operate to survive. The impact upon business is then seen as over rated and NAB just bounces back again. Much like Chinas SSE. The ASX returns to its former high prior to the virus within a few months and this period of selling is then seen as a steal.Just seems the most logical outcome to me.Average in to be sure and consider a six month reassess time frame.
