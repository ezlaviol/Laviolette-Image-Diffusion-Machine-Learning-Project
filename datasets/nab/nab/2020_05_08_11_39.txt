In many cases they will have to sell down current holdings to get the 30K. Then lets say they participate and only get allocated $2K in shares. They now have 28K not invested and if the market has moved up in that time they miss out in a big way (the reverse is true as well). Add to that they may have to pay tax and transaction fees on accessing that 30K also.
