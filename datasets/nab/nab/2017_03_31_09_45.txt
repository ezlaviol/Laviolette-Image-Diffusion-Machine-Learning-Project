2017-03-31T09:45:00+11:00 : SYDNEY, March 31 (Reuters) - Australia's competition  regulator on Friday said it would bar a group of the country's  largest banks from bargaining collectively for access to Apple  Inc's  AAPL.O  contactless payment function, potentially setting  a global precedent.  	The decision, the first of its kind, will stop the banks  from introducing their own mobile applications on devices like  the iPhone and Apple Watch that could be used for contactless  payments instead of the Apple Wallet.  	That would have enabled banks to circumvent transaction fees  and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps,  potentially unlocking more of Australia's contactless payment  market.
