2020-04-27T10:38:00+10:00 : Ross McEwan and his sycophantic Board should do what Ross McEwan does to others and cut themselves from NAB. It is not GLTAH here as the holders of the stock have allowed two people, Ross McEwan and Simon McKeon, historically from CBA, RBS and AMP, who have underperformed the market and underperformed in governance, risk and compliance. Now NAB sholders are suffering as the CEO and Directors underperform, but it is not just a 20% underperformance as they perceive. It is far worst. They could be the world's worst and least capable of all Banking boards and management. After what happened at RBS and AMP in the hands of McEwan and McKeon, it is highly farcical how they have been allowed to do the same at NAB.
