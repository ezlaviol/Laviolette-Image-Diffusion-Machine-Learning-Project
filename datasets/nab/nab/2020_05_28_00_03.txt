2020-05-28T00:03:00+10:00 : A couple of minor points I'd raise are,1/ You don't appear to have considered any ineligible overseas shareholders' shares among your 604 million shares figure and,2/ I'm guessing those applicants who'll be getting their full $30k application filled to the tune of 2120 shares, would be those with 8480 shares and above, hence the 25% figure announced later in the day by NAB. So your 10000 sh example may need adjusting or my guesstimate does.
