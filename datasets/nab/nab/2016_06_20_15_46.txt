2016-06-20T15:46:00+10:00 : Disagree with small bounce, think it will be large bounce, as hedge funds were heavily weighted on Brexit side assuming worst. I think the covering on Friday and until st leger's day will be quite something. 

ASX might have smaller bounce compared with S&P 500 and FTSE but still with a T+2 settlement cycle, ASX bounce should be pronounced as hedge funds on the short side get fully flushed out. This is already happening with POO affected oil and gas stocks.
