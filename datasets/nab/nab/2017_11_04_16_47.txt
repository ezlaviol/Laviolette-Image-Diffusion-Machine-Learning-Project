The $1 drop on results has likely got more legs but was muted due to pending divvy. Expect her to regain a bit leading into the divvy, but then fall by more than $1 ex divvy. Possibly $2 drop in the days ex divvy as stragglers get out following the results. 

I might exit 50% of my holdings just to hedge in case I'm wrong, not sure yet.

I've begun to feel uneasy about our banks medium-long term. Not sure if I should be as weighted here as I am 10% in NAB.
