2020-09-01T18:08:00+10:00 : As a long term hold, I wouldn't exactly call this stellar performance, would you?10 years worth of NAB..And for those not satisfied with 10 years  worth of chart:The only thing supporting the above chart at these levels, for the last 20 year's, has been the fat dividends. Those fat dividends are now under pressure. if you look at the above chart and factor in inflation, NAB shares really haven't exactly been stellar. You can argue all you like that covid has brought unprecedented downward pressure on the bank stocks,  but the banks have been languishing for 20 years or more.Each to their own though.
