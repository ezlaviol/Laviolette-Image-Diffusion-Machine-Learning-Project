2019-05-03T17:52:00+10:00 : I was getting part pension as at 28th Mar18, so I am one of the lucky ones that is not affected.
nevertheless, I would like to see that condition grandfathered, but none of the Labour people would confirm to me as to what'll happen if my portfolio suddenly gets up over the pension threshold, which can happen if the share market goes right up.

The LNP stuffed me up with the Tapper Rate and now Labour is going to stuff everyone up. No thanks. For me, I am going to vote for the sensible independents (??). That way at least when Labour wins, they have the Senate to contend with. Don't forget, it ain't Law yet!

Labour looks like getting in though.
