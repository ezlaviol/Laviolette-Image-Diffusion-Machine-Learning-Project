It's one thing for the Commonwealth to impose a tax on pretty much whatever they like, but how does it work for a state? Imagine if all the states pile on. Can't remember the exact figure ($360m over 4 years rings a bell), but if everyone decides it's a good idea it becomes a pretty hefty figure.

I can live with a Commonwealth supertax, it kinda fills the same role as the 2% debt levy on high income earners (and reducing debt isn't a bad thing), but an income-style-tax from a state? If my business had a market cap of $77.74billion I'd have at least one bloke in a basement somewhere sitting between a photocopier and a steam pump distribution valve working on a solution to get rid of this tax.

"The ABA did not respond immediately to the announcement". They were probably down in the bowels of their office block lookin' for my guy.
