2016-06-26T00:38:00+10:00 : You never know what will happen on the markets, and nothing would surprise me but it will be remarkable if the ASX bounces on Monday after -600 on the DJIA Friday night, although the ASX did take a hammering already on Friday so there may be a perception that the bleeding is done.

Perhaps we will need to see what the European & USA markets do on Monday night to set the tone.
