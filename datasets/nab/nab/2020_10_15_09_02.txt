2020-10-15T09:02:00+11:00 : Given the pandemic and its impact on small businesses especially in Victoria, is NAB at a higher risk exposure compared to the other 3 banks as it generally plays a bigger role in SME loans? I have stayed away on this basis from NAB but I wonder if this is fact or mere hearsay. Thoughts appreciated
