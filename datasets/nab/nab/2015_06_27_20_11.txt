2015-06-27T20:11:00+10:00 : The prospectus seems to suggest otherwise to my reading?

I have had a look at the benhb prospectus and that contained a specific buy back clause which allowed the bank to buy back notes with an on market purchase of notes.

The nabha prospectus only contains references to a buy back or exchange at face value (ie $100).
