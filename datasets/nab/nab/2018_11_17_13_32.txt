2018-11-17T13:32:00+11:00 : Ive been doing the ME bank thing for ages. Every Monday morning I buy a Piccolo Latte from Maccas for around $3 and thats my weekly purchase 

Have an alarm on my phone to go off every Monday morning at 7am as a reminder. Bonus interest is great. As soon as my RABO 4 month period expires ill transfer back to ME.

Best thing about RABO is a 100k transfer limit compared to ME @$20k. Thatâ€™s come in handy in some larger transactions.
