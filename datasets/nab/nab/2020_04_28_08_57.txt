2020-04-28T08:57:00+10:00 : my cba example isn’t cherry picking it’s a performance measurement since inception...ie ipo. I’d always hold NAB due to weighting one index anyway.as long as you beat the index you’re doing fine.going 100% into a few tech stocks most of which where highly speculative at the time is gambling. with such stellar returns boasted you’d be the number 1 hedge fund manager in the world making 4%pa base fees with another 30% performance fee on top of the benchmark. Which is why I’m highly dubious of internet hindsight prophets.
