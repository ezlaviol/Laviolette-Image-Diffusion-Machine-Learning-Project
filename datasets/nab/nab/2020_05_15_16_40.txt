If you hold it at that price and it does its range trading to mid 17s you effectively getting the SPP price climb anyway.What advice to you give people at 15.4 level? It goes lower, effectively achieved nothing. If it goes up, you lose out on potential gains. You're in a NO win situation.*START RANT*Side note: Computershare you need a "SPP Applications" link.
