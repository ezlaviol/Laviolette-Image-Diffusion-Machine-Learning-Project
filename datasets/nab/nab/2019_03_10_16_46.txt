National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB)
Whilst the banks have risen strongly over the last 10 weeks, I don’t believe it is too late for income investors to snap up their shares. One of my favourites right now is NAB due to its high yield and overweight exposure to a commercial lending market which is performing well. At present NAB’s shares offer a massive trailing fully franked 7.8% dividend.
