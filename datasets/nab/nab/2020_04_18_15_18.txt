2020-04-18T15:18:00+10:00 : I had a little nibble at ANZ this week ($16.32), but been slowly adding NAB as well. Love buying anything under $16.50 in particular. At a completely random guess I feel maybe 50-60c dividend (maybe I'm being optimistic, guess we'll see). I'm DRP-ing and hoping to build up my holding while prices are down.Who knows what the economy will look like in 6 or 12 months, but I'd wager the big 4 banks will adapt and survive...
