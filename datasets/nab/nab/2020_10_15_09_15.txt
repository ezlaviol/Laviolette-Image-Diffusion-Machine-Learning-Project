2020-10-15T09:15:00+11:00 : You would have to think they're all equally exposed.I.e. not all sme businesses will go to the wall as a result of covid.  It only increases the chances of any defaults.Hypothetically, nab could have a sme loan book half the size of ANZ but if 50% of ANZ goes to the wall and 25% of nabs go to the wall they both end up in the exact same position.  the chance of these things increase not the certainty.  Ditto home loans.at the end of the day which bank does better is as much to do with good fortune and lending policy as it is with luck.  Banks will recover but the higher the price jumps short term the more uneasy I become given headwinds.
