2020-05-28T17:20:00+10:00 : I stand to be corrected, it can only happened if you BORROW money to invest regardless of what the investment is and the outgoings(interest etc are more than receipts thus difference can be used to lower your tax rate.Capital gains i believe are separate beast one issue of capital gains/losses many over look is regardless if held over a year if your have a $10,000 loss carried forward for eg and you then make a $10,000 gain a year after investment many people reckon their gain is counted at 50% not so, one cancels the other out.
