But I also don't agree price action, which I understand to be technical analysis (correct me if I'm wrong) really shows so much either. Again I agree that anyone claiming to know what the market is doing is speaking baloney.

I try and look at the maths, look at the price action, look at the fundamentals and then... take a punt. But that's trading which is different to investing. I tend to think that if you are investing then anything sub 30 for NAB is a pretty good deal.

Trading is more appealing to me because I've started later in life and need to take some risks before it becomes too late. I wish I had started a decade earlier because investing is probably a better strategy.
