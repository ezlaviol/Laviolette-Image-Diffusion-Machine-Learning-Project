2020-05-01T14:09:00+10:00 : I was also having nil success with Firefox.  Have managed to log on using Chromium (on Linux op sys).Don't know whether I was just lucky or not, but at least I'm now able to access the IRESS platform.Mobile platform is awful to navigate.Still have Nabtrade Support e-mail pending an answer regarding how to access IRESS via backdoor.Hope this helps someone.
