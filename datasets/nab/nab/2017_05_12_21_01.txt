You obviously didn't read the context of what has been said. Voting in Australia is compulsory and each individual has the right to joining any political affiliation they choose. The cop out is the notion that "I just won't vote because I don't like them". That's a common catch cry today and causes the rise of extremism and populism. We have seen how the supposed saviours of our political system behave when they get what they want which is balance of power so they can cut some deals. If you don't like what is going on get in there and do something about it - at least try - don't just "cop out"
"Voluminous empirical evidence" proves that apathy leaves the decisions to others so it is easier for people to just complain............................................
