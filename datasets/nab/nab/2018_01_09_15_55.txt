2018-01-09T15:55:00+11:00 : I'm hearing from a number of internal sources that NAB are promoting inexperienced women over more experienced men to get their female quota up. Anyone else hearing such stories? NAB have made a lot of mistakes over the last 30 years by getting involved in a an American home lender, then a UK bank etc so would not surprise me they making more judgment errors. Could be a good take over one day just like CBA took over Vic State Bank eh? 

Anyway if any old NAB banker reading this today or could look up your historical records of the year the NAB issued a couple of  NCD's to HBA at 24% & 26% pa for 4 years. I remember it clearly and check with one of the ex-directors of the insurance company I worked for then and he agreed he saw sky-high interest rates.  

So anyone in Archives?
