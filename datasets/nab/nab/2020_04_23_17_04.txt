Rest will be international shares and bonds etc.Thats not that much.its a good move from the government. It’s a cash injection into the economy of already concessionally taxed money that can go into the economy which it won’t have to fund. Sure it’ll have an effect on the pension payments in 20-40 years time. But you can bet your house on it that the aged pension will not exist in its current form in 20-40’years time. It’s unaffordable as is.
