2020-08-05T12:05:00+10:00 : lol I’ve saved ~1.30 per share in capital since last week. That’s better than the annual return.The proceeds are just in my trading account for the time being. Currently evaluating alternatives, feel no need to do anything just yet.Might actually upgrade some outdoor lighting at home with the saved capital and re-buy shares in the future. Maybe, but feel there’s better shares out there too.
