2020-05-27T17:14:00+10:00 : Mick - I wish I knew - and all the banks went up in sympathy.Maybe all the gold bugs can see gold falling and decided the better option were banks.Will be interesting to see if the trend continues or we see a big dump of $1.25 bil of $14.15 shares over the next few weeks.Strange day for sure and more life in bank shares today than in the last three months.
