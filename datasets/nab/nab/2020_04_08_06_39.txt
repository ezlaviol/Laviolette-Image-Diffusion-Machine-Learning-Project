2020-04-08T06:39:00+10:00 : all this Wuhan virus havoc could all become a thing of the pass if Beijing repays the $6.5 trillion compensation arising out of this crisis. NAB sholders just lose one dividend payment and one reporting date. I do not see it as a big deal. So, if none of the $6.5 trillion is repaid, trade sanctions could cut off the Mainland from the world, and that could be used to bring Beijing back to the table to compensate the West for this awful virus.If Beijing became like Havana, NAB would be a beneficiary.
