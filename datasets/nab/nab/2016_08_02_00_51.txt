In the meantime I have done something you probably would have not, so I will bore you with the details later, unless it ends up being really embarrassing and then I will predent like it never happened ￼￼ and smack my twitching fingers myself .

Anyway, back to banks. NAB closing on 27.25 though possibly retrace tomorrow and who knows what the RBA will do, I would do nothing if I was them and save it for later, but who knows. If nab goes towards 28, question is when to exit? Div still some time away. Is there enough time for a fall and new rally? I am thinking not at the moment but will have to wait and see. CBA pushed past 78 today, I am starting to think if the numbers fall right I should exit post dividends. Hmmmm  too many variables for my simplistic brain. Will probably know more after cba announce their results (and you eat cake  and I am starting to think double cream would be great to accompany it). 

Still terrified what could happen if Trump wins.... Gold would probably be ok but with trump even that may not be safe.
