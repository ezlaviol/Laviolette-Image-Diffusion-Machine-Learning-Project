You'd be struggling to find a stock that hasn't done this over the same time frame given the depressed prices around 20th March 2020 from the global Covid lockdowns.Yes that is a fair comment; we have only just recovered to our pre-covid share price. But that in itself is a fantastic financial result considering what all Aussies companies have been through over the last 18 months. Things could have easily turned out far worse for all the banks, especially if bankruptcies and loan delinquencies had ballooned. And the fact that we are back to the same share price despite a very large dilutive cap raise at $14.15 suggests that NAB has been managed reasonably well IMHO.
