2021-09-02T23:55:00+10:00 : Hi NABersNAB shares will easily break 30 possibly in the next few days and a lot more.  The share buy back will ensure new highs are on the way.  NAB hit 40 in 2007. I think that this was after another buy back during that time.Hoping NAB will increase their dividend at the end of the year. They haven't been paying much out over the last few years and are cashed up as a result. So come on NAB throw a bit out to shareholders.Best of luck NABsters. Always good to talk to you. Back to Lithium I go.  ORE  cant go anywhere but up. Not cross promoting just a tip so relax.Stackey
