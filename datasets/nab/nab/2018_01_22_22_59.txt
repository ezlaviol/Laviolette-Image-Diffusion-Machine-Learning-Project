I just use basic broker supplied candle stick charts- good for showing what has happened in the past but no guarantees for the future. Personally think it is a screaming buy at current levels. I have my doubts it will get much if any into the $28 levels (Yes, I know thats only a cent off).  Tomorrow will tell, good luck with $28.80, I was happy paying $29.01.
