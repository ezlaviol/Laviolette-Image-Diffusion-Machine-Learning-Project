2018-05-20T14:58:00+10:00 : You’re not facting in CYB spin off. NAB worst of the banks though, with the other 3 performing well. I couldn’t care less if I have 0 growth in NAB over the next 5 years. If they maintain $1.98 f/f I’m happy. As id beat inflation and my tax effective return would probably outperform the ASX or global index. I’d say the market is pricing a dividend reduction, and I wouldn’t be surprised either. Still a 8% tax effected return would be good to me/is. I think banks are cheap (not pricing in any growth) unless we have a housing bust, which like the 1990s is possible, although a low probability. Rather stagflation and alight declines for a decade.

Re above comments. Depends on your portfolio size and investing criteria. Admittedly I missed CSL, however grabbed many other blue chip bargains (significant top ups) like BHP, NCM and WPL etc, equally some industrials I bought a ton of 2010-2012 that have done well. Myself as well as the family portfolio is merely after wealth preservation and our strategy is to buy blue chips when in distress. Notwithstanding anything with structural or debt issues we will sell/won’t touch. I won’t buy high PE stocks like CSL or a2m etc which as we’ve seen time and time again crash once growth is exhausted. In fact I sold all our FGL spin off TWE shares earlier this year, not at the top, but near what the price crashed to last week. Personally I’m low on funds until early July dividends, but our private investment cos and SMSF have around 15% cash allocation net. I can stagger buy a huge amount over the next few years. 

My/our portfolio has around 40 stocks from the ASX with varying weights generally within the ASX100. I’ve Topped up on 3/4 the big banks recently as long term I think they’re undervalued. My investment horizon is 5-10 years or longer for generation, ie to my children.
