2020-04-29T15:16:00+10:00 : I am thinking of selling 20K (I don't think I will get 30 K because of over subscription) worth of my NAB holdings at around these pricesand then apply for 20 K worth of NAB at 14.15.Despite taking a hair cut I should be able to recoup some profits and lower the average price of my holdings?
