Inevitably, there will be small companies that will go under but banks are basically huge and the impact will not be massive or lasting.We will be looking at banks being flat for maybe 12 months but there will be recovery into the future.There is nothing wrong being hesitant and watching what is happening before an investment is made. Good luck.

I'm in two minds as I feel you're post is on the money and I'm looking at taking a long position in the banks at the bottom of the interest cycle ,but hesitant for one reason - will the banks take a big hit in the next 1-2 quarters with defaults in commercial loans expected to be terrible- and maybe put futher pressure on the s/p of NAB ( most exposed)Cheers
