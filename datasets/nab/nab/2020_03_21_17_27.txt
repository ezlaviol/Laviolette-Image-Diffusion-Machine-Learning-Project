2020-03-21T17:27:00+11:00 : Should I go out and hang myself now?Geez, toughen up boys and girls and get a  grip. What ever happened to taking life as it comes and being a bit more resilient. The world is not ending - and 90% of people who get the virus don't even have any symptoms it is so mild. Hate to see how some people react in the flu season.The panic caused by the media hype and ham fisted reactions by those in charge is causing an economic disaster but it too will come to correct itself.

We have very little time. Today in Australia we have already passed 1000 cases. If we continue down this path, two weeks from now we will reach 20,000 triggering a massive health and financial crisis. The number of cases doubles every 3-4 days. The world is about to melt down. This could as bad as the Great Depression if not worse. Analysts now are starting to wake up to what is about to come down.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/analyst-anticipates-worst-crisis-since-1929-amid-recession-fears.html
