2015-10-29T10:52:00+11:00 : A little surprised to see NAB down in trade again today after a bad day yesterday.

Profit report up 20%, dividend of 99cps being recorded next week, they have already raised capital, and a probable rate cut next week by the RBA... I'm not exactly sure why this is being sold down except overall negative sentiment towards the Aussie economy as inflation rates were reported very low this week.

Anything I'm missing?
