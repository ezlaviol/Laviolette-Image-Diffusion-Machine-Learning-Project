2016-10-14T13:11:00+11:00 : Australian shares traded cautiously on Friday after weak  Chinese trade data raised fears that recovery in the Chinese economy may be short-lived. 	The S&P/ASX 200 index (xjo) edged up marginally at 0.01 percent or, 0.4 points at 5435.9, on track for its biggest weekly drop in four weeks. 	"At the moment we are fluctuating between red and green.. I think we are going to finish the week with a down day", said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut. 	China's September exports fell 10 percent from a year earlier, far worse than expected, while imports unexpectedly shrank after picking up in August.  	China's exports had been expected to fall 3 percent, slightly worse than in August, as global demand for Asian goods remains stubbornly weak despite heading into what is usually the peak year-end shopping season. 	"(China data) was clearly taken negatively by the markets.  That is why we are seeing resource stocks getting sold off today," McGlew added. 	Materials and financials were the biggest drag on the benchmark index.
