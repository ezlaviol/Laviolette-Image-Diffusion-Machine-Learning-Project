I had the outlook of just holding them for a year or more to get to this kind of price or greater, but you're right. I decided for now to take 25% profit on Wednesday because I was more than happy with that. If I miss out on a big jump in the next week, then so be it. I'm still happy with the decision. If I can get some cheapish again around the $17.50 mark then I will get back in. However, I'm not certain that's going to happen.GLTAH
