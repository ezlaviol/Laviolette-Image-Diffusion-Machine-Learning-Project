2020-03-23T23:18:00+11:00 : Macquarie have put out that NAB could cut the dividend to $1.49 then to $1.33. even at the lower end its around 10% on todays price.This mess is far from over but I guess its a matter of determining what you consider to be an income stream you can live with, lock it in and ignore the price.$500k today will pay just on $50k pa assuming a 20% cut in the current div.No doubt $13.88 is not the low but 2 years from now a 10% return will or there abouts will be fantastic whilst the cash rate will still probably be zero.
