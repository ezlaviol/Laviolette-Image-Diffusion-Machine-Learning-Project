2020-03-23T21:34:00+11:00 : Comparing COVID19 to the GFC is tempting but COID19 is an entirely different situation.  All rests with retro viral and vaccine develpoments combined with the effectiveness of social distancing.  Australia should have been more aggressive on social distancing a lot earlier but that is history now.  The GFC had entirely different dynamics.  I know there is a need ot be able to compare COVID19 with something.  You could be right but I am hesitant to use GFC as a benchmark.
