2016-03-17T17:36:00+11:00 : Two partners in port project have entered administration  Means port charges are now higher for other backers  Glencore plays down impact of extra port fees  Project has been hit hard by slump in global coal prices  	Glencore  GLEN.L  and five  other miners backing the world's most expensive coal port in  Australia face extra annual charges of A$150 million after the  restructuring of one of their partners this month, the latest to  buckle under slumping commodity prices.   	The additional charge will deal a blow to the remaining  backers of the A$2.6 billion ($2 billion) Wiggins Island Coal  Export Terminal (WICET) in east Australia at a time when they  are grappling with floundering coal markets.  	Mining and trading giant Glencore and seven partners began  negotiations to build WICET in 2008 near the height of a coal  boom, but prices have plunged 75 percent since then on global  oversupply, China's slowing economy and competition from natural  gas.  	Expecting coal markets to remain strong, the partners had  agreed to pay port fees for 27 million tonnes whether they  shipped that volume or not - setting themselves a tonnage charge  as much as five-times higher than other coal ports.   	The project currently charges around A$20 a tonne, several  people familiar with the terms said. Neighbouring RG Tanna coal  port at Gladstone charges about $5 a tonne. WICET Chief  Executive Marcus McAuliffe declined to comment on the charge.  	But adding to the partners' woes - and those of their 19  lenders, owed more than $3 billion - coal prices have now pushed  two of WICET's original owners, Cockatoo Coal  (COK)  and  Bandanna Energy  (BNG) , into administration.  	Both were stung by port charges for capacity they were never  able to produce after coal prices crashed to nine-year lows and  funding for their projects dried up.	  	"The world didn't unfold, the coal mining sector didn't  unfold, and the mine development didn't unfold the way everyone  was hoping for. Then they were left paying four times what they  could pay shipping through the terminal next door," said Stephen  Longley at PPB Advisory, the administrator for Cockatoo, which  emerged from a restructuring this month.  	The grand hope when it was planned was that WICET would  eventually ship 120 million tonnes a year, fed by what would  have been Australia's biggest coal mine, Xstrata's Wandoan. But  Glencore shelved Wandoan in 2013 after taking over Xstrata.			TOUGH TERMS	  Under the terms of the port agreement, the rest of the WICET  partners - Glencore, Wesfarmers  (WES) , Baosteel's  600019.SS   Aquila Resources, Yancoal Australia  (YAL) , Guangdong Rising  Assets Management's Caledon Coal and New Hope Corp  (NHC)  -  now have to pay the amount that would have been due from  Cockatoo and Bandanna - A$150 million a year.  	"Every time one drops it makes it more challenging for the  rest," said Thomas Jacquot, a senior director at Standard &  Poor's.  	Glencore played down the impact of the extra costs,  indicating that charges would be capped if any further partners  dropped out.  	"The incremental costs to Glencore imposed by existing users  at WICET are contained by commercial protections and must be  viewed in the context of our greater global coal production  business," it said in an emailed statement.  	The other remaining partners declined to comment.	  Glencore must shoulder 40 percent of the costs, reflecting  its share of the port's 27 million tonnes a year capacity,  meaning it has taken on an extra A$60 million a year in costs on  top of the A$218 million a year it was already paying.  	And the pain is worsening for Baosteel's Aquila, which has  yet to build the Eagle Downs mine that committed to using 1.6  million tonnes of capacity at the port.  	That implies Baosteel is spending A$32 million a year for  its unused capacity plus bearing an extra A$9 million from  Cockatoo and Bandanna.  	Distressed debt investors fed speculation last year that  WICET's banks, nervous that the project would find it tough to  service debt amid the coal price slide, were looking to sell the  loan backing the port below par value.  	WICET's McAuliffe dismissed talk of any urgency to  refinance, with the nearest deadlines around three years out,  but said they would look to cut costs, including interest costs.  	"WICET as an organisation is underpinned by some very strong  balance sheets," he said, arguing against "knee jerk" decisions.	 ($1 = 1.3172 Australian dollars)
