2019-11-02T23:18:00+11:00 : We can go back a few yeas and make the point that bank shares had a higher SP but that has been slowly recovering and this year that has been dramatic. on 2nd January the NAB SP was $23.63 - a 20% increase - and at the current SP the return is 8.3% before franking. SP come back a bit from its highs of something like 29.92 but a 20% increase taking that into account does not look like a dead duck to me.Your point about "buy and hold with banks is dead" makes little sense to be fair.I think banks will have a settling time for sure over the next two or three years but dead, they are not.

""  Though MissG, there have been several of these predictions of "high tide" for the banks  None have eventuated so far ""  Have a look at XFJ chart and tell me the high tide wasnt 4.5 years ago  .  In fact it could be said the High Tide was 2007  . Long term banks holders have nothing but Yield in that time   . Buy and Hold with banks is dead and has been for a long time  .  ANZ div cut with a FF cut is the start of the decline  .   Sure you  can trade banks and i do  but a trader should have sold them inside the last month for the recent high will not be beaten for a long time
