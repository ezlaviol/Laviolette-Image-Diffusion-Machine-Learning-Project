2020-11-20T16:09:00+11:00 : we are still in crisis pricing. So not a true indication of value and performance. Equally you’ve omitted dividends, which are part of your performance attributed. Macquarie isn’t a bank, it’s an investment bank, benchmark that against JP Morgan, Goldman’s etc.CBA by far is the stellar bank investment on the ASX, NAB is actually the dog. Nevertheless I hold a lot, like all banks. They’ll recover, I just don’t see $30 anytime soon. I’ll use the dividends for other sector investments and top up again in times of crisis. Mind you I do have a few thousand shares at $30-$31 unfortunately. However overall cost is around $20.
