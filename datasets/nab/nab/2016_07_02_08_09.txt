2016-07-02T08:09:00+10:00 : As I thought (guessed) a little pullback yesterday. Election results are given to the coalition but then the UK was suppose to remain so who knows. Flat on Monday I'm guessing again. Dow still needs some profit taking which should start early next week. Tempted to kick off @25 or close to it if we get a little dip
