2018-05-04T13:11:00+10:00 : A good entry point IMO. Should rise pretty quickly as we get closer to the record date hopefully. 


Yesterday's announcement caused a slight dip.

"NAB (ASX:NAB) reported its net profit fell 5.7 per cent in the March 2018 quarter, compared to September 2017’s quarter, with NPAT hitting $2.58 billion. Compared to the same time last year, NAB’s profit rose 1.5 cent."

This is the same simple % loss/gain YTD comparison of the big 4 that I posted previously up to yesterday's close.





DYOR, IMO, This is not investment advice, I didn't do it, no one saw me, you can't prove anything...
