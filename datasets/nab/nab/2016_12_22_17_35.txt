2016-12-22T17:35:00+11:00 : all depends if there is a better alternative as well and right now cash is dead money so holding banks seems to be worth the risk.. entry point is key and mine is 27.. even at 35 bucks and without increasing divi we're looking at approx 5.7 percent yield before credits ( risk of capital loss increases of course) 
so there is scope for the CG trade and still for the long term hold win win either way, there's a number of events or changes that can trigger 'sell the banks' some of which may be evolving now but that does not necessarily mean 'sell now' as those events may not transpire the way we predict..
aus $ falling also makes it cheaper to buy for foreign investors.. how much impact that has i do not know
