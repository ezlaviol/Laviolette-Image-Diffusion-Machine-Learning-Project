2016-06-13T19:23:00+10:00 : Yep. Might even buy a couple of gold stocks tomorrow 
Asx might start low. Dow recovered from 160 down to 119 close iirc. 400 down would have been better, but wait till I grab a gold stock or 2 . Wish I had of bought RSG a couple months ago! Ahh well, wishing and hoping don't make money. Futures are only down 17 at the moment which is bugger all. Our big down day was Friday. Brexit all over the news. Told ya it would be an issue 
Personally I don't see an exit happening but every poll comes back differently so who knows. It's the next Grexit, only with a B!
Come on $25.01
