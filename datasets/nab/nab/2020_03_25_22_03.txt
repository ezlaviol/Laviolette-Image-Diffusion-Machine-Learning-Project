2020-03-25T22:03:00+11:00 : completely agree, most businesses missing guidance by 5-10% can echo a 20+% sell off.i’d expect most business can keep it to around 40% this quarter, next quarter it won’t be a missed guidance it’ll be a matter of how far in the red they’ve sunk. It’ll be write downs and credit raises. I’ve lived through this before, this will be the bottom, because this is were everyone realises the truth and how much they are in for.I’d expect it’d take many years to undo the damage, I don’t believe there is a switch that you can flick to make it all good again.People are going to bleed badly for the next 9-12 months. There will be few in a position with spare money to invest into shares as food and shelter is generally a higher priority.A small rally today is nothing more than a courtesy to remind us its not always down. I won’t be unleashing the war chest in this rally today.Although I sound down beat, I have been buying took a decent bite at $13.50 and I believe long term opportunities are 100% there. I just think some people don’t have enough market knowledge to be playing with this kind of volatility.on that note I reduced my holdings by 20% today at $15.something. Yes this is pointless because yes they will be worth much more than this in a year or 2 but I leverage trade to I need better tactics. If you can afford to go long 2-3 years, yes you will do nicely on this IMO.
