2017-03-02T23:40:00+11:00 : Difficult to say - I think Trump has had a fairly good impact on markets overall since taking the chair so it looks good for NAB (amongst others) but going forward he is equally likely at some point to say or do something that causes a financial/banking crash. So I see Trump as a 50/50 bet on the markets.

My outlook: Cautiously optimistic. Happy to hold but not buying more right now.

I'm fairly heavy in NAB and she looked very good today, likely to give $33 a nudge soon which is a great result given she was $26 in November last year.
