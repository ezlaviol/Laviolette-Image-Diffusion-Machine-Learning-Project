Many people not shorting at the moment and going with the flow....Its all buy, buy and not much sellers around.Cant see much turnaround in the Record profits,job cuts,Share buyback merry-go-round.But I know one thing for sure the reduced staff numbers in Banks will come back to bite them on the arse one day.More work for less people, productivity drives have been non existant for some time.
