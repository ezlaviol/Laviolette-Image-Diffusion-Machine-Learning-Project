2019-02-07T22:35:00+11:00 : Market hates uncertainty. uncertainty is Hedge Funds paradise. Have a look at NAB Bad Debt  Provisions,(due to Housing Crisis) it is massive..NAB Share price may slide by 50 cents to 80 cents (around $24/Share) tomorrow before it settles between $23.50 to $25.25..Market hates uncertainty. This departure of two executive at top does not mean more will not go. I am sure few more at NAB top will be either sacked , forced to leave or simply resign...
