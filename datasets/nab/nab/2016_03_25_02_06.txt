2016-03-25T02:06:00+11:00 : Well... Today just showed once again that this market is incredibly volatile, and a stock that rises on the ASX is usually just heading up to the surface for a gasp of air before it sinks again. Boy the banks were belted today, I thought NAB was particularly bad until I glanced across at ANZ down 5.2% 

Let's hope the extended break over Easter allows some news to flow that might encourage our market to rise from the dead!
