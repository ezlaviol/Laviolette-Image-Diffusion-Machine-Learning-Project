2020-03-28T18:00:00+11:00 : I could well imagine that banks will drastically cut if not suspend dividends altogether for a time .
Smaller cap companies have already done so .
I’m a firm believer that “ hibernation “ - pressing the pause button is the correct strategy .

As for margin loans I’ve never had them, although occasionally tempted , I remember the wipe out of the GFC .
If you can I’d be strategising and acting now to reduce them .

Disc : I hold other banks but not NAB at present
