2016-06-12T00:32:00+10:00 : I still have milk, but even after the recent 15% increase, it still owes me money. I hate losing capital  so it better keep climbing. It says it will pay a dividend but it has said a lot of things, I'll believe it when I see it. You could be right about PLS, it's in a holding pattern. I have 60K of shares so not a huge amount. I am hoping it has a lot more to run; they are due some announcements, including DFS, soon. I looked at GXY last few days but it was after merger talk so I felt I had missed the rise. Good luck with it though.  
Hopefully the sell off overseas doesn't run out of puff by Tuesday. Looking for CBA below $75.00 and BEN as close to $9.00 as possible (hopefully lower) as they are heading into div. Come on shorters !! (where's Lurkin ). Also NAB, ANZ and BHP (missed buying in for its last run last week by 4 cents - Aaaaargh) if low enough. Now that I think of it, I also need to get more money for all these stocks so I better do some work next week as well  .
