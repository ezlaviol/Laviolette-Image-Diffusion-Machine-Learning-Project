I remember in 2008, Citi bank share price in the US went to $2.

$2. It's was always gonna come back. Told a USA mate to buy that shit up. 

It's at $45 ish now. 

The big 4 are always gonna b ok, better than now. 

I bought at $16.75. the question now is "do you want to take a profit and hope it drops back a bit before the inevitable move up?"

 Or hold no matter if it goes a bit up or down for the next few months. 

Tough choice. We all know in a year we should be sitting mid $25ish .......

Good times. 18% gain in 3 weeks is hard to ignore...
