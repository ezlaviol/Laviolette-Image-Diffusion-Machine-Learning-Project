We're only 3 months into this one hence why I think $13.19 is not the lowest it's going to go this time around. The idea is to make money in the in between period when there's huge volatility to lower your average price. When the economic outlook is stable again you'll be sitting pretty with a very low entry average to reap the rewards for an extended period of time ( months or years before it plummets again).
