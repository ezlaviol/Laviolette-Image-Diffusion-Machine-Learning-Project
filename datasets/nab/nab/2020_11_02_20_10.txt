2020-11-02T20:10:00+11:00 : Westpac gave out 31c as a final dividend and that was after being fined $1.3B by the AISC. We should be able to do better than that although WBC didn't pay a first half dividend at all while NAB paid 30c. My guess is 35 to 40c just to send a positive message to the market. We'll find out on Thursday.
