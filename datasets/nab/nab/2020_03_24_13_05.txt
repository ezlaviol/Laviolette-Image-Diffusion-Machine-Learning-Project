They have an agends - not sure what that is, or maybe they are jealous of people who  went out of their way to invest.I don't know what pitiful reason they have but I can suggest to people owning NAB shares to concentrate on the fundamentals and not their negative propaganda. Ignore them altogether. They thrive on thinking they are getting attention.

No one can pick the exact bottom.... it’s 50% sales now and yes it can go lower but this is a long term investment.. the next time you see this will be another 10-20 years ?
