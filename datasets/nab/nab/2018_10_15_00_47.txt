2018-10-15T00:47:00+11:00 : lol...$25.80 or $25 if it gets that low...hard to pick exact precise bottom. I think at $26 flat NAB is undervalued. In less than 4 weeks juicy fully franked dividend coming and yes next year perhaps div may be trimmed but not such a bad thing. There will be a reversal of buying into the big 4 shortly. The banking commission has been cloud for a while and housing slowing but well i feel thats all well and truly factored into NAB under $29. We just had  a wall street correction once markets get over fitters should see some upside.  I like a host of shares very profitable companies all sold off  from NAB, ASX, AWC, IVC, WPL,AGL all sold down recently
