2018-09-03T21:06:00+10:00 : This reminds me of when me and my partner went into their Randwick branch the other day at 3pm to open a new joint account; only to be told it was too late as they close at 4pm and to come back another time.
So we sat in the branch and opened the account over the phone.
Same guy that said he couldn't help us then came up as they were closing and asked us to leave, but let us hang around when I said I was on the phone to NAB opening a new joint account.
But then wouldn't accept our ID (that we had to show to open the account), because they were already closed.
lol...my experience is nothing compared to what's going on at TRC, but as an investor in NAB and trying to become a customer, I was absolutely shocked how terrible that experience was.
Even the guy I was speaking to on the phone couldn't understand why the staff in the branch wouldn't help us.

Why do they even bother with branches if they don't care about customers?

Something tells me there is an "uber" of banks just waiting to happen any moment.
