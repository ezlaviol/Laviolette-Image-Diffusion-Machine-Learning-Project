0128 GMT [Dow Jones] NAB's (NAB.AU) dividend faces more scrutiny. A combination of weak capital generation in the recent fiscal year, a higher share count after an equity raising, the loss of earnings from businesses it is selling and the bank's reinvestment in its core operations leads Morgan Stanley to question whether the dividend is sustainable. The moves by the bank are helping its relative loan-loss performance, but the brokerage says it also makes NAB more vulnerable than rivals Commonwealth Bank (CBA.AU) or Westpac (WBC.AU) to deteriorating credit quality. It forecasts a flat dividend payout for the next three years but says the probability of a cut is certainly increasing. It has an equalweight call on the stock and trims its target to A$30.10 from A$30.80. NAB is down 2.7% to A$30.87.
