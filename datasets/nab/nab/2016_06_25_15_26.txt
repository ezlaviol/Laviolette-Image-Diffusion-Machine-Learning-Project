2016-06-25T15:26:00+10:00 : I thought we were due for a new thread...

I'm still researching the full implications of Brexit, I've seen a few HC posters suggest it may have potentially positive and/or neutral impact on NAB in particular but the fact that NAB dropped 4% (or around $1) on Friday tells me otherwise.

IMHO it's worth reflecting on how this news will impact the USA and the DJIA (because our market tends to follow) and again I'm observing Friday's movement on the DJIA (down a monster 600 points) as a strong indicator of how negatively Brexit is perceived.

I don't see how the ASX can go anywhere but down on Monday, and I'm expecting around another $1 to be shaved off NAB at open.

Of course the BIG QUESTION is; what happens next?

Three days of blood on the DJIA (and the ASX) from here is a scary proposition for holders but a potential opportunity for savvy buyers. Of course those savvy buyers will look silly if we see three weeks of red on the markets... So what to do?

I will be making a decision about how much $ I'm willing to put into NAB in the medium term, and most likely 25% of that $ will go into her on Monday pending a big drop. The rest stays on the sidelines and of course I'll be watching other opportunities and I may decide to allocate the cash elsewhere.

I don't have a target price but I'm thinking $23ish is a real possibility on Monday. Just my 2c worth.
