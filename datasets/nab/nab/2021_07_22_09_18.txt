All the banks have been paring back operations to core business and not many opportunities to grow that core outside of organic growth.
It appears a sound strategy to look at outside growth opportunities and if the bank is in a position to be able to fund from surplus capital even better - certainly is not necessarily a worse outcome for shareholders than a share buy back
Of course I do not know figures involved with the Citi proposal so can't comment specifically on it amd yes NAB needs to ensure it is a wise purchase.
NAB obviously needs to assess the value of the Citi business now and in future under the NAB umbrella and that it represents best use of capital.
Some figures around this scenario may provide more insight as to value against other options such as return of capital if able..................
