However you remind me of a fellow student, coming over to my place time and time again, asking for answers, explanations and solutions, following thru with a 'I don't agree with you'. 

I normally gave him a beer and told him to take a hike in a friendly way.

In hindsight, I am still curious if he came over for a free beer, a social visit, to give me a hard time, or all the above.
Never gave it much thought.

Enjoy the profit and the sun.
