2018-10-31T11:30:00+11:00 : This forum is great example of the current state of the ASX.Shareholders care only for themselves - hope they get a good dividend and don't care about the best interests of the business. I bet most of you haven't read any company announcements in the last year. The bank is in (perhaps short-term) decline. Multiple graphs from the half-year show this. They are paying huge costs to restructure, yet are increasing the headcount. Only an Australian bank could end up with more employees after culling the workforce.
