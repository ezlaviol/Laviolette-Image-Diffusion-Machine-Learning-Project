My uncle worked for NAB, has since moved on. Was disappointed on his comments from NAB which did target the other big 3 banks too. Loyal customers are treated poorly. But again, please don't take this comment as a "I don't like banks". He had a lot of valid points about the way they have been conducting themselves.

HOWEVER, we need to remember a few things about the banks

1)Without banks the economy will collapse, period... An if anyone mentions decentralised Bitcoin or the like you will get a tumbleweed response. The too big to fail theory has stood the test of time.

2)The royal commission wont last forever, an can be looked at as a good thing, the banks themselves have some questions to answer, fines to pay and some wrongs to right. Once this is all said and done, I think banks will come good.

3)Interest rates are at an all time low. This cannot be the case forever and when it turns around there will be money to be made.

IMHO, NAB is an excellent buy in at anything under $27. As I believe in a few short years it will be back up above $30.

Again this is my outlook only. DYOR.
