2020-06-01T10:38:00+10:00 : Unsure why you would consider this notice in any way "bad news"
We all know the bank placed $3b worth of shares and I have no problem with a fair portion of that going to Vanguard.
This notice obviously covers the period since last notice (July 2018) so covers a lot of trades but without putting all on a spread sheet it is obvious they are generally bullish NAB and have been increasing their stake all through that time. (Obviously they buy and sell!!)
This notice states they have increased their holding by over 55m shares and by my calcs they purchased a bit over 10m shares in the $14.15 placement, so even taking out any buys or sells around the placement time, they were still a significant net buyer
A quick scan also shows that apart from some larger sales around the placement time they have continued to be a net buyer as it has risen from recent lows.
Personally I find this a much better indication of NAB than the nonsense posted on here from some of the naysayers who advocated selling (at the recent lows) and forecast the steady demise of NAB!!
