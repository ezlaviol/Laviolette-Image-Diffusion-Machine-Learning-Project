You will see with in the year or two bank share prices will collapse. Their customers will all move on to smaller credit unions that don't meet the criteria for the levy. To stay competitive the banks need to avoid passing the levy fees to customers but this will then cause a drop in profits and growth which again leads to a lower share price.
