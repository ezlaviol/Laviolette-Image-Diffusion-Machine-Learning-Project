2017-07-30T18:17:00+10:00 : NAB's SP has been becalmed around $30, everybody in the market reckons it is worth $30, no more no less. I do not know what ads you are referencing but what else can NAB do? If everybody thinks the share price should be $30 and there is no sign of any breakout or breakdown, it is becalmed as the Bounty. As slow as a Clinton voter, a snail on a picnic: the answer is always going to be $30.

If it is not about more than money, then the answer is: the SP of NAB is about $30.
