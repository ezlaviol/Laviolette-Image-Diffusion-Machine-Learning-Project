I was reading the AFR and it appears some analysts do not like the results.Watermark Funds Management, said: “NAB has delivered a relatively low quality result this morning compared to major bank peers.” Source - AFRUnfortunately I think we may see more selling in line with other banks share price falling on results, yet we may see a small rally as ex dividend day comes around. I also noted the the way NAB has suggested a “mood of greater caution among households” which was reported in the AFR.I find this a bit concerning as if confidence is vanishing quickly from the economy this is going to hurt banks profits into the future IMO.
