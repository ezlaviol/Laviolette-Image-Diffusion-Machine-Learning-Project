2016-02-03T21:52:00+11:00 : I'm not only comparing today, I'm comparing over 1, 3, 5 and 10 years... It looks awful for NAB.

Otherwise I agree with pretty much all your points, which is why I'll hold and DRP for the foreseeable future.

But (like you) I've been thinking (hoping) that NAB will outperform its peers, making up for previous lag... And she has failed. I've reached the point where I am willing to stop hoping and simply invest more into CBA.
