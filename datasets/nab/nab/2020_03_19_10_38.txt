One way to see if you may be developing lung fibrosis is to take a very deep breath and hold. If lungs are inflamed you will have difficulty holding for ten seconds (Japan method). If this happens along with fever then you have at least two weeks at home watching Netflix and trading the market.... Yaaay! Anyhow, this should not be considered a replacement for actual tests, but since you most likely can’t get actual test kits.... Well.... here we are..... Also I note that if you are quarantined there seems to now be no food home delivery, so how this is supposed to pan out is anyone’s guess.. While I may also be a registered health care practitioner, it seems the beurocrats overlooked Medicare for many in the scheme, so without any access to any actual collaborative safety initiatives provided by the government like many of our registered over regulated health services many of us despite often being first point of contact with public health have zero access to basic evidence based safety as we have no Medicare needed to support patients optimal care communication, all while being told by the health beurotwats we are registered for “safety” without any Medicare to be provide optimal benefits for public which kind of matters as the current environment shows. All I can say is “on ya borris the beurocrat” didn’t think that one through very well did you? However, DYOR and please always be aware that these days... squirrel only ever looks out for one person .... Squirrel. Hey, now I am wondering if they are likely to also stop the asx like many other businesses?
