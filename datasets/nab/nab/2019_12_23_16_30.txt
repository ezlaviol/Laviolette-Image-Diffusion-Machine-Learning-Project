2019-12-23T16:30:00+11:00 : There is no end to the NAB saga now Combank is recruiting Business bankers to go after the NAB clients. Talk about dog eat dog , the face of Nab branches needs to alter drastically . People employed to market their services need to get amongst the people to find out what really is requiredCertainly elderly people are not fond of internet or online banking and need to be coveted rather than shunned by the now generation of bankers,as after all, we have lots of cash and liquidity, which the upper echelons of the banking world tend to forget. Happy Honika...
