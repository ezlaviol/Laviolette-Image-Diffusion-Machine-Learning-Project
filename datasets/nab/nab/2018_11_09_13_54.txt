NAB popped on my radar after the big drop from the ex-divi date...

Thinking of buying now or at close as it's looking very low.

Any reason other than the dividends their down now? Only reason I ask is all banks are up except NAB .. even Genworth is up lol 

Also nothing online (news wise) to indicate their about to feel a massive fall. 

Any wise old traders who can throw their 2 cents at this?
