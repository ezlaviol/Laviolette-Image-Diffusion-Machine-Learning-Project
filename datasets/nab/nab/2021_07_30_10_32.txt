2021-07-30T10:32:00+10:00 : did APRA force them to do buy back? the fact is if they were forced (which i don't but assume they were) then could have used those for more productive way then simply buy back within a year. They could have reinvested that fund for growth or better opportunity or give the fund back as dividend instead of collecting $14 from INSTO and give them back $25... which is the issue not the CR.
