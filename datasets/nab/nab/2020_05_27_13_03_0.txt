2020-05-27T13:03:00+10:00 : Here's how I calculate the estimated scale back %:315M shares held by retail shareholders at record date21% of this applied for SPP = 66M shares held by the retail shareholders who participated.Divide 66M by 155,000 (number of participants) = 425 shares which is the average number of shares individually held by those who participated.NAB issuing 33M new shares to 155,000 participants = 213 shares per person213/425 = 50%So it will be 50% of what you held at record date, but with a minimum allotment of $2,500.If you held $1,000 shares and applied for $30,000, you get $2,500If you held $10,000 shares and applied for $30,000, you get $5,000This is my assumption
