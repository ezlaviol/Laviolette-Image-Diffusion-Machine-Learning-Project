2016-02-03T18:07:00+11:00 : As far as i see it add 93cents to NAB's ending share price today and you have a general idea of where NAB should have finished the day. Fingers crossed London markets do well today as Clydsdale floats there soon if not it could look ugly for the release tomorrow.

Again i am a long term holder of NAB so it doesn't faze me, i prefer the NAB shares without Clydsdale and will keep those as a small diversification as i feel the business can be run better on its own.

Might be a rocky ride on NAB in the next week or two, just put your seat belt on and don't look out the window..
