2020-04-28T21:03:00+10:00 : Don’t you just love how insto shares @ 14 or so in recent placement will list on Friday 
Already in the money by about $1 or so on today’s price 

SPP documents will be sent on Monday .

I don’t know why insto shares cant be issued at same time as SPP 

I will almost bet by the time spp shares issued share price will be close to the spp price 

instos can trade theirs on Friday 

quick bucks to be made before long suffering retailers get stock
