But NAB is improving its balance sheet from the interest ..... and I  own  a bit of that interest. And while I'm at it.    Yeah, this Spp could have been handled better.   But its raised over a billion more $$$$ for NAB to make use of .... thats BTW  the NAB that I own a bit of .... and the share price is up 3 % ... A glass half full is ok.
