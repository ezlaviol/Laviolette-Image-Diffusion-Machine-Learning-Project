2015-11-21T16:34:00+11:00 : I would not mind another opportunity to get NAB below say $31 might evolve and I am sort of betting the wobbles may return.

Wall Street looked jumpy again on Friday, Wells Fargo and Wachovia similar to CBA starting looking edgy and then the market got a bit of confidence and she closed up 50 bps.

It was not conclusive and NAB might push towards $35 but otherwise have an inconclusive week.

But long term all good.

How do you rate the big 4? Would you score CBA and ANZ above WBC and NAB? How would you do it?

What about BEN and BOQ? Is BEN a microcosm of NAB given their Victorian centric portfolios?
