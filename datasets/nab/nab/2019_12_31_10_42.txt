2019-12-31T10:42:00+11:00 : JC - I think you are a bit off the mark a bit Have a look at the NAB CEO's statements over the last three or four years. He actually made a statement in one of his addresses that CBA was had the most advanced on-line netwook and that his aim was for NAB to catch up and be as good as CBA in that regard. NAB has put a huge effort and spent a lot of money chaseing that goal - which also included matching and taking market share off COMSEC.I agree with you regarding valuations. Anything under $25 for the banks (except CBA being so much bigger) are bargain basement prices. The real clincher for that will be any further reduction in dividends - I think they will come down but not as badly as predicted - maybe a maximum of 10% and probably less for NAB (maybe 5%) as they have already made that hard decision over six months ago.

CBA is an old styled public savings bank, Netbank goes down alot, the ASB portal in NZ is pathetic. NAB has too many retail branches, BNZ still has too many branches full of nothing but bankers doing God knows and not enough governance. ANZ and Westpac appear to be the most digitally able. They do not appear to have too many branches, seem efficient, perhaps too efficient given their scandals and governance problems, perhaps they need more people not lessNAB is still undervalued under $25 AUD IMHO, CBA is massively overpriced for what it is, ANZ and Westpac massively undervalued although WBC had a good day.
