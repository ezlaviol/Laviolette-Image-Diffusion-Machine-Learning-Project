2018-05-26T19:00:00+10:00 : I recently worked in the IT department at NAB and was then outsourced with 500 other infrastructure specialists to IBM, remaining on the NAB account. Most technical roles, including mine, were later off-shored by IBM to India. I don't actually have a problem with that, but IBM was badly prepared for the complexity of a large bank and the off-shoring was very poorly organised. The result of the outsourcing to IBM was a high level of dysfunction. I don't owe NAB or IBM anything and I'm in a different industry now.
