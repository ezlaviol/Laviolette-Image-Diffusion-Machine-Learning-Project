BEN retraced after I sold, now forging ahead as expected with the other banks. Didn't buy on the dip, thought I would try some gold; not sure if that is going to work out better. Will let you know when it's over. 

Ann was good, but not great for Mrs Market. I held too long (there it is again) and now below 55. Fat lady has not sung yet as I am still in.

So we were both correct. 

But I don't see a cut. I see cake .
