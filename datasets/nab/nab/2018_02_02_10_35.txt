2018-02-02T10:35:00+11:00 : May see several short term periods related to DIV announcements:  

(a)  often longer period prior to announcements of results and dividend, 

(b)  the period between announcement results and going ex-dividend,

(c)  a short period of prices dropping when going ex-dividend.

For all price changing periods,  out timing is important
