2017-11-05T09:31:00+11:00 : I didn't think it was a bad result, hence I bought more on Friday. If the market continues beyond 6,000 post ex dividend this will follow up. It wasn't an earnings downgrade with tends to pull a stock down for several months... I think NAB was overdone. 

Large dividend, cost cutting and still some growth. They've settled and don't have issues like CBA (I hold CBA from ages ago anyway). NAB has been the worst of the big 4 since the GFC, but the UK issues are not sorted which dragged it. I think NAB has a bright future as a simpler model and cost cutting will deliver a nice buffer.
