2017-03-27T00:42:00+11:00 : I hold a few of those hybrid type securities and a return of 2.75% unfranked is woeful, even at the previous lows of $65 the yield still falls well short IMHO although maybe some buyers thought it looked OK? I doubt it.

So are there insiders that expect a buyback as you have suggested? 

Hard to explain.
