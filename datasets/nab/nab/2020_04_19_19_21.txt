2020-04-19T19:21:00+10:00 : Perhaps NAB should rename itself and become NKB but I think attaching your name to North Korea although alright with the current Scott Morrison political class, may be rejected by the next Dutton/ Sharma/ Bragg leadership so I think the Australia bit just has the wait for the leadership challenge?The lockdown has been very catastrophic for NAB? I think McEwen should have come out more strongly against lockdown and the economic destruction like say Goyder and Shepherd.McEwen appears extremely lacking in leadership. Did not go too well in RBS and now even worse than that at NAB now just by reviewing the performance, SPs and lack of dividend growth?
