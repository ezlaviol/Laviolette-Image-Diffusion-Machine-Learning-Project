2016-07-07T13:12:00+10:00 : I pretty much agree with everything you've said, but just wish to add one important point:

You've pointed out a nice yield scenario if divvy is reduced and the SP drops... But I
if one were to buy at (say) $24-$25 this scenario is not so good - because the yield needs to be calculated on what the buyer actually paid for the stock, i.e. on the amount of money actually invested.

So whilst a hypothetical 10%-12% at around $20 SP sounds OK, it's not OK if one paid $25-$30 for those shares. Apart from the 20%+ paper loss on the SP (which is terrible) the yield on the actual monies invested is not so good.

Anyone who thinks the divvy might be reduced and/or the share price could take a tumble should definitely not be buying now... IMHO
