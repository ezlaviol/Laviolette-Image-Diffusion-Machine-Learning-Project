2018-05-06T16:21:00+10:00 : As I read the earnings report again over the current weekend,... one noticeable thing worth mentioning is :-

The dpu payout ratio increased to a whopping 97% for period till March 18, compared the previous periods n the table which were only reaching only 70% +. The reason given here is because restructuring costs were being taken into account. Without restructuring costs, the payout ratio still increased to 81%.

Hence, if NAB keeps spending a lot on restructuring, then the dpu can't be sustained anymore unless NAB is comfortable with a payout that exceeds its earnings per share. WE all know such a payout can't last forever,..

I'd appreciate opinions here.....
