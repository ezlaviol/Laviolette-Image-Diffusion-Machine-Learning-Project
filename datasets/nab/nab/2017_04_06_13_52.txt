If you bought today and by midyear the price was down 30% the long term effect of not haveing bought later would be the total return dropping by 30%. This means that if the total return was going to be 80x over thew next 25 years, you would instead "only" get 56x. Then again the property bubble may well not burst for years to come and when it does happen the SP only falls back to todays levels, in the meantime you had been picking up DRP shares. Not buying today would then leave you worse off.

The SP has climbed and fallen many times over, one of the worst times to buy in would have been 2002 when the share price was over $36. Still you would have an 84% return on that investment today in spite picking the worst buy in. Not exactly phenomenal, but hardly going to ruin you.
