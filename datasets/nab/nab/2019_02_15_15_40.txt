2019-02-15T15:40:00+11:00 : Feb 15 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd  (NAB)  said on Friday it would more than double a capital notes offering to about A$1.65 billion ($1.17 billion) and that strong demand prompted the bank to close its bookbuild earlier than scheduled. 	The margin on the notes has been set at 4 percent per annum, the bank said in a statement. NAB had offered A$750 million of notes under the program earlier this week, which it said it would use to refinance existing securities.  ($1 = 1.4102 Australian dollars)
