Definitely seems like a buy time. I didn't want to "top up" when NAB was approaching 36 as I thought that was a tad retarded.Had it in mind i'd top up if it got below 35 however...Also can people clarify for me the writting about the dividends? Its written in a way that doesn't seem straight forward to me.Ex-Dividend of 14th may....that language reads to me the dividend is known on the 14th/announced.Record date 16th May. Says to me that provided you own as at the 16th you will be paid the dividend announced on the 14th on the 8th of July.However I might have misunderstood all that.....in short when is the cut off date to own stock.
