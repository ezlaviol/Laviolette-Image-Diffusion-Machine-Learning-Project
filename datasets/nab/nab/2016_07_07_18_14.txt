nab is at near 52 week lows, in my opinion its in oversold territory, its impossible to pick bottoms, eventually one has to make a decision to buy a high yield stock like nab, even if it does drop like you say, the div yield would still be compelling and there is a high likelihood that after a drop of say another dollar or two then the yield play becomes even more compelling and hence investors jump in and push the sp back up.

if it wasn't for our mates at the rating agencies, nab would have been well into the green today. once again for every perceived negative we can always find a positive. so lets look at it, AAA is under review, is it such a big deal, you would be lucky to find a handful of countries which still hold a triple A rating in these current global economic conditions. I think this is the new normal and we have to get used to it.

like my last post we can punch holes in all the so called negatives, another example, everyone is concerned about the property market at the minute and the flow on effect to the banks, again this is a bit of a concern but Australia is still very fortunate, our friends at the RBA still have 1.75% of ammunition to play with, which is a damn load more than most other countries.

end of the day rates are not going up any time soon, they are probably on the way down, based on that banks are certainly a decent place to park some money, with a fairly decent degree of safety and a very nice yield. within the context of the banks I feel NAB has a bigger yield and I feel it should hold relatively stable.

anyway im far from an expert, my personal opinion only, do your own reserach

good luck to all.
