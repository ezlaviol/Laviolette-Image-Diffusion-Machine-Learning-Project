My logic is that now the deal is approved, people will have already attempted to work out the longer term impact of the separation.  So that SHOULD be factored in.

However, there is a value in the CYBG shares (anticipated at around A$4) so the each NAB share should drop around $1 when it goes ex-rights.

Well that's my logic anyway - it isn't always identical to the market's logic
