The only reason most people buy shares in banks in the first place is for the dividend. IT is an expense to make the bank more competitive and should really be inherent to any basic running costs.  Cutting a dividend is a sure fire way to lose investors- just look at MTS share price to see what happens when temporary cuts occured. Nice idea in theory, but not usually the desired effect.
