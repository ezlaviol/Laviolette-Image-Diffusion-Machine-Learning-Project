Not sure you can use falling immigration & increased jobless numbers in the same argument as one cancels the other to some degree. You failed to mention record low interest rates that will help stimulate the economy once COVID is under control and that Government and banks are working together to manage this self imposed recession. Yes, I'm optimistic of a good recovery in the banks within a year or two.
