2020-03-15T16:10:00+11:00 : Friday rebound was first major signal that market went into heavily over sold territory...Both NAB and WBC are few weeks away from major dividend, funds/ETF will grab any opportunity to buy around these price. At least they will get 5% return in dividend within weeks (even if price stays same)..As per my understanding after listening various TV pundits, Friday rally was mainly ETF/fund managers buying high dividend stock.
