2020-04-28T07:18:00+10:00 : you’re both in a different situation, you have high concentration risk. I could not have a few stocks due to size and risk, NAB is just one of 40 odd positions I have outside index funds. NAB over 10 years is bad as we are in a crisis, however it’s fine from the long term positions held. You’re equally using the hottest and best performing stocks around as hindsight and some form of a benchmark making 1000% returns in short periods. I can tell you know CBA has delivered way more than that even using today’s price since IPO when factoring total return, sometning you haven’t grasped yet.you don’t even benchmark against the asx200 accumulation index so you’re operating in a different world to me.
