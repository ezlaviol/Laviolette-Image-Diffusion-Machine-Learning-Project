The big banks are up in arms about another duty being added to their job description that of tax collector.

On the ladder of loathing, banks are only a rung higher than politicians.

The government’s $6 billion hit to banks is simply playing to the crowd.

The reality is that the banks won’t be paying the tax. The bean counters have already worked out which deposit rates are to be trimmed, which fees are to be increased, and what loans are going to be taken up a few basis points.

I’m not so sure there’ll be too much trimming of dividends. After all, investors chasing yields keep share prices up. And there’s nothing like a healthy share price to trigger a banker’s bonus.
