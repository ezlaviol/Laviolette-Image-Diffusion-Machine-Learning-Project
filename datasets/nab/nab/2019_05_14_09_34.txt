Again, this emphasises the true value of franking credits, whether or not Labour prevent refunds to those entitled. As long as they don’t fiddle with that then we’re ok to accumulate stocks like NAB. Picked up some more yesterday, and will go ex div today, SP will be lower but that’s ok in the longer run value will show up as will tax free dividends continue to be paid out. Most credible analysts still see the banks undervalued by the market, notwithstanding the large provisions for previous misdeeds being paid out. My mind goes back to the 1990’s when banks similarly had large asset write offs following bad decisions and recession, they ultimately rectified their balance sheets and grew stronger. Long live the banks, hate them but we need them.......DYOR
