2019-01-01T13:51:00+11:00 : Smirk. Probably the worst post I have read this year.The market indicates nothing. Financial stocks have always been volatile .  This year probably more volatile than most due to the  RC  and Trumps trade wars with China.The importance of Banking stocks to the Australian economy cannot be understated. Bank stocks have been some of the best investments on the ASX attracting investment from around the world. The dividend has been excellent and will continue to be excellent. Your view that the dividend will be cut substantially is fanciful thinking. I can see no reason why the dividend would not increase. At the moment the dividend yield would be around 8.5% excluding franking credits. If you take the franking credits into consideration the yield would be around 12%. Not bad money!RC findings due soon . If they are not too harsh expect financials to run. Resolution to trump trade wars will push NAB over 30.  Future dividends? IMO 2 bucks plusStackey
