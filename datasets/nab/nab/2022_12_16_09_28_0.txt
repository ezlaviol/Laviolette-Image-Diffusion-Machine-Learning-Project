Whatever has happened, we will see, but you would not want to be a NAB Director right now with the Star matter moving through the Courts.A clean out of the NAB directors would be a good thing.But when will AUSTRAC and ASIC act like FINCEN And SEC and go after all the executives? After all, they do the understaffing and the cost cutting that allows for the money laundering.Is it not time for ASIC and AUSTRAC to go after the executives as well as the Board Directors?
