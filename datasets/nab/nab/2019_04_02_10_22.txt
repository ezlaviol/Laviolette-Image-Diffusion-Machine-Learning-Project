2019-04-02T10:22:00+11:00 : Goldmans Sachs slaps buy rating and $30.95 valuation on NAB shares

The National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB) share price could be cheap according to analysts at Goldman Sachs who earlier this month slapped a buy rating on the Melbourne-headquartered lender.

The NAB share price is actually down around 24% from $33.74 to $25.04 over the past 5 years excluding the impact of dividends that have remained flat at $1.98 per share over the past three fiscal years to take the total return marginally positive over the period.

However, Goldmans has a $30.95 12-month price target on NAB shares with its optimism based on NABâ€™s successful costs savings program, a smooth leadership transition, and flat revenues over the short term.

NAB is also reportedly targeting a cost-to-income ratio of 35% by 2021 that goes to show its excellent profitability as a lender.
