At 28.29 the grossed up dividend is 10%, which is not bad at all. NAB has been pretty much about dividends these last few years, rather than capital growth. I doubt this will change in the foreseeable future. CBA has not had much capital growth either recently for that matter. For a portion of my portfolio, I am happy to take the dividend without the capital growth, though I wouldn’t be impressed if the SP went backwards in the long term. I definitely don’t want another TLS .
