2019-02-05T08:24:00+11:00 : Henry and Thorburn argued at the AGM, where Henry did a lot of mansplaining, that they were the figures to bring about a change of culture in the organisation. I happened to be in NAB offices in Melbourne and overheard the national managers of financial counsellors talking. They were rooting for Henry at the RC, virtually standing and applauding Henry 'kicking goals' for the Bank. I have seen better behaviour from Collingwood supporters. Not a culture to foster.Henry, you have ZERO ability to bring about change, resign! Andrew, go!And let the SP recover.
