2020-11-05T11:21:00+11:00 : It would appear from the comments in the capital management section (Appendix 4E) that NAB aren't going to underwrite the Div this time. (although not totally clear - could always be an Ann later)
Perhaps with APRA limiting payouts to under 50% earnings and with sale of MLC, capital is sufficiently covered to meet future requirements and underwriting not considered.
To me this would be good news as NAB has been a regular user of this capital preservation tactic for some time.
Westpac ann'd the other day an underwritten Div, although they had a couple of other hits.
No discount on DRP shares also continues.
