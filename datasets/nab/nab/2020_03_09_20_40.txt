That means "normal service will resume as soon as possible". So if they are accepting our exports as normal, and we are buying their exports as normal, what reason can there be for continued market rout? None that I can see.Sure, I don't think it will rebound like a rubber ball, but hopefully will begin to slowly creep higher.I bought a few today and may buy some more tomorrow. Averaging down.
