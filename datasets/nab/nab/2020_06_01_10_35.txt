2020-06-01T10:35:00+10:00 : A telling moment for Covid restrictions will be USA in 7-10 days. Little regard to Covid restrictions at the moment so lets see what happens with Covid over the next week or two there. If we get a major spike in cases there, restrictions everywhere gain validity for remaining in place. If no major spike, perhaps we are holding on to restrictions too long?

Just a thought.
