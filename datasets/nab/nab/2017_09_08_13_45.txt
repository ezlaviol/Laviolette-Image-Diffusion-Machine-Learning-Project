2017-09-08T13:45:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Australia's banking regulator  will ask banks to keep aside more capital against their housing  portfolio but does not expect overall ratios to rise beyond the  existing benchmark of 10.5 percent, Chairman Wayne Byres said on  Friday.  	Byres said housing was an obvious place to boost capital  ratios although there will not be a "dramatic increase."  	The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) had  tightened lending rules for mortgage debt earlier this year to  help reduce banks' exposure to the country's red-hot property  market in the event of a sharp correction.
