The tax time sell off is upon us I'm guessing low 20's to possibly even below 20 by end of months, coupled with the uncertainty on economic structure and uk the banks are on the merge of sp collapse, I will be waiting till October before I put the money back into the banks, any short term rise is still nothing in the grand scheme of things as there is too much uncertainty in the world right now, the only thing certain is death and taxes and both lead to a lower share price....
