On some threads you have people posting endlessly on stocks they say they don't own. Why do they do it? Most of the time it's not out of the goodness of their own hearts... 
As you say sometimes downrampers have good points. You just have to read between the lines. 
I make my own decisions, that way you can not blame anyone else. I will say that I have been influenced by two posters on HC, one starts with an S and the other with an N. I am aware of that so that is ok, still my call.
I was thinking of you when Nab went below 24....can't believe you didn't get any, but so it goes. Us futures still negative, but rising, so maybe it will drop again. Good luck. At this stage I have no ammunition until the July the 1St. Sigh.
