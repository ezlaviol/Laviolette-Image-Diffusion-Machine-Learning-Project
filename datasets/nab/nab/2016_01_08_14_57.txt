2016-01-08T14:57:00+11:00 : Not every company sets up electronic voting like NAB has done here. I have e-comms with as many of my shareholdings as possible yet still get sent paper booklets and forms at times, the Asciano takeover is a current example.

Btw, I'm still to receive a scheme booklet (I downloaded one) and voting form from NAB. I voted from the Clydesdale demerger website.
