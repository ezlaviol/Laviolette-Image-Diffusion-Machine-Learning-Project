I have been wondering for years how people fund all the amazing houses they live in and fast cars and boats etc. I guess it's all borrowed.Funny thing is; Morrison & Fryderburg seem obsessed with avoiding a recession.To me, recessions are a natural part of an economic cycle. They weed out unhealthy businesses and provide investment opportunities.When a recession was avoided during the GFC I think it sowed the seeds for a worse one now.
