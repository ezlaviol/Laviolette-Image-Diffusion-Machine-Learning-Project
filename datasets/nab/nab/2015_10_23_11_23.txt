2015-10-23T11:23:00+11:00 : more people will start to look at alternatives for their housing and investment property loans going forward as bad publicity for banks and mortgage brokers will be the winners ... Aussie banks are also susceptible to property losses going forward as more job losses and reduction in pay comes through from the end of the mining construction boom .... the FF divs are not what they have been historically and the banks are struggling to grow their loan books and not keen to lend .... can only mean pressure on their business plan and we all know how slow they are to change processes and will have issues for their growth.  I am out of NAB today while the screens are green and out of all banks, better medium term growth stories to be had elsewhere in mid cap space where the smart money is ... just my two cents worth.
