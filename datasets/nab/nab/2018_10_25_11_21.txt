2018-10-25T11:21:00+11:00 : Hardly surprising. After months of bad press in the royal commission which is believed will place additional costs onto the banks, I think banks are no longer flavour of the month with the big funds and SMSF's.  I know I liquidated some of mine due to the belief that they are going to be cheaper shortly so why not sell and buy back later.  Additionally the Nasdaq is now in a correction and no one would be surprised if the Dow and S&P500 are soon as well.  In the past, I have been too early jumping back in to stocks when I think the correction is over.  Cannot see any need to hurry this time around especially as trend is clearly downwards and annual results come out soon.
