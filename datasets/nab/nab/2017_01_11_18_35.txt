2017-01-11T18:35:00+11:00 : $32 was where I hid my Ask, $32 seemed a nice anchor to get out at and perhaps due to someone else on this forum or other mentioning $32 as an anchor.

I thought there were other places where I could lay a bit of capital for a while until the T/A and the Chaikin oscillator (volumes on the way up have not been sustained) got a bit better for NAB.

The T/A showed that it was likely to hit either $32 or $32.50 and fall back. $30.65 seems a decent resistance, even the HC charts alongside our posts show that so the unsophisticated will definitely all trade back to this level and that includes the algos and the bots.

For some reasons, NAB has round number anchors such as $30, $31, $32, $25, $26, $29.60 before inflexions. Seems hideous but I guess I joined the hideous trend of trading off anchors.
