2017-11-02T18:55:00+11:00 : Nov 2 (Reuters) - British lender CYBG  CYBGC.L , spun off  from National Australia Bank  (NAB) (NAB), will take a pretax  charge of 39 million pounds  ($51.7 million) to help to cover  the cost of the UK's payment protection insurance mis-selling  scandal.  	CYBG said on Thursday that it is lifting provisions for  so-called "legacy conduct costs" by 403 million pounds as of the  end of September.   	Under an agreement it has with former parent NAB, CYBG is  required to fund 9.7 percent of this provision increase,  resulting in the 39 million pound charge, it said.  	This will hit CYBG's 2017 CET1 capital ratio by about 20  basis points for 2017, though the ratio will remain "comfortably  within its 12-13 percent guidance range", the lender added.
