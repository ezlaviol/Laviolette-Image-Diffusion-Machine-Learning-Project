The last deck of cards not to be affected are the banks but the big banks in the US are downgrading each other (quite funny when you think about it) in a tit for tat fashion. Mind you CBA has done all it could to artificially keep the price up through DRP. Next they will probably try a buyback and on it goes. NAB is already doing a buyback.The japanese have run out of ideas with their banks and now they are asking the government to continue to buy in. We could probably call all of this "artificial insemination". That is all that you can do when no one loves you.
