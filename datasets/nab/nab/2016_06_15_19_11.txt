I was half expecting a bounce towards the end of the day so the sell off at the end caught me by surprise. Anyway spent too much yesterday so I don't have a lot of ammunition left.

I am definitely thinking green tomorrow and possibly Friday, though Friday is too far away. Like everyone else tipping fed to leave rates on hold overnight and the markets will rally..... 

Let's see what happens. 

Still envious about your nab pick up.
