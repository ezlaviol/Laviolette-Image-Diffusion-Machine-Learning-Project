Even it that drops to say a low of 75 cents, the yield at $22 is still approaching 9.7% before franking. So, that is very attractive.Will investors think that $22 is the new minimum base line or is there still a small decline still to be factored in.Some have suggested that it could fall to $20 but I am not sure there is much downside left under $22. Maybe a small decrease but it may bounce around the $22 mark rather than a steady decline.

It's a bargain at this price until it drops lower.
