2020-03-24T16:13:00+11:00 : Bit of of a late surge with NAB at 14.27 at close. Puts todays rise in line with the other banks.

Disappointing NAB looks to be giving back her gains today. Investor confidence in this share is on par with me before my yr 12 formal. Will be interesting to see what happens with the dividend. Hoping it stays at 83c and certainly that it doesn't get cut completely.
