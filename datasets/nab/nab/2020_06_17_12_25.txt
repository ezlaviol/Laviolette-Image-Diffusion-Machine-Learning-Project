2020-06-17T12:25:00+10:00 : if nabs share price doesn't fall to 11.xx - 16.xx between now and the end of July I'm a clueless noob with 12 years trading experience behind me. I'm waiting with 201k to buy 12,000 nab shares in one hit. I won't spend the money on nab unless I can afford that. that equates to $16.74 ps after selling my last lot at over $19 a share and clearing 45 grand profit. long term trading is not for me. I'm I'm only interested in quick short term cash with a maximum 1.5 month turn around.
