2022-05-04T07:45:00+10:00 : May 4 (Reuters) - Australia's second-largest lender National Australia Bank  (NAB)  on Wednesday joined three other big banks in the country in raising its home loan variable interest rates by 0.25% per annum, following the central bank's cash rate decision. 	The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday raised its cash rate by a surprisingly large 25 basis points, the first increase in over a decade as it pulls down the curtains on a massive pandemic stimulus.   	NAB joined the country's biggest lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia  (CBA) , Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  (ANZ)  and Westpac Banking Corp  (WBC)  that announced a similar raise on Tuesday.
