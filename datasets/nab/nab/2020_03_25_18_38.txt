that’s highly probably.like the first instance was panic - stock piling inventory from the supermarket and selling off liquid assets to protect from unemployment.the 2nd round will be more precise and calculated,people will sell liquid assets to cover illiquid investments - property & businesses. The second round is only a few days away.So good to get a breather from the heavy selling, but I would say an 80% chance of further heavy selling is likely for the next few weeks.After that I’d anticipate a bit more sideways movement through financial reports, where we will finally understand how bad the damage is.XAO closing above 5,000 IMO it’s setting up for another sell off.
