2020-05-14T13:40:00+10:00 : I don't think there will be a V-shape recovery. A lot of headwinds for the banks. Westpac forecasting a 20% base case drop in housing prices - closing our borders means stunted immigration and housing demand. Farmers taking hits from China trade tensions -  NAB is a big agricultural lender. Fundamentally changed behaviours like working from home instead of the office will impact commercial property values and their lenders. That's on top of stuff that was already pressuring the banks before covid, like low interest rates, misconduct compensation costs, and loss of market share to nimbler fintechs. That said, share price is very cheap. NAB trading at below net tangible book. And the CEO just dropped a big on market buy recently. I think the risks are high, but mostly already reflected in the SP. I'll be taking up my NAB entitlements next week barring a market crash.
