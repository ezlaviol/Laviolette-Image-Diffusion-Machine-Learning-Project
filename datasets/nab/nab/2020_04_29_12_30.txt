2020-04-29T12:30:00+10:00 : Can’t comment on why price has shot up other than we’re having a good day on the market and perhaps Buyers think NAB has been de-risked. My point is that I can sell today at $16 and buy at $14.15 (risk not getting full allocation I know). Will do a bit of research on past SPPs to see if you must remain a holder (apologies I should have done this before posting the question).
