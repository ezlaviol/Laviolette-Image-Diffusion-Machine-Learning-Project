In fact I think you haven't done badly  (if at all) ... but only you can calculate that .... I suggest  that you can still participate in the spp if you have funds. you can call the NAB helpline  1300 367 647 for assistance. btw I , like others , had Problem keying in my HIN ...... I did eventually use Computershare and that worked ok.
