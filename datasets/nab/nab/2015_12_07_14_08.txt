2015-12-07T14:08:00+11:00 : I understand that we should hear the details of the Clydesdale IPO this week.
My understanding is that 75% of the stock will be distributed to existing NAB holders while the balance will be sold off through an IPO.
Any thoughts on valuation?
My inclination is to hold for a period as there has been a degree of takeover activity in UK Banking in the past year or so with a LLoyds banking spin off going to a Spanish Bank:
