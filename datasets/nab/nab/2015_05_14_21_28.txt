NAB is a good un, pity bout its choices in Northern England, Scotland, if it had chosen better, it could have made a killing, everything is so can do Cameron over in England. They even seem to be able to hold the economy 2gether during the winter snow and ice. The East Coast shut down over New Year, the Mayor De Blasio called a weather catastrophe when there was none, the economy once roaring shuddered. NAB went down 2day due to the Australian reaction to a US economy stopping for a weather event. Who would pick that for herd stupidity?
Guess Shorten would say it is all down to climate change, Global Cooling? Funniest politician in the world 2day, Bill Shorten, a shorter's Cinderella Man.

The Shorten video: "I Agree With PM, But I Donâ€™t Know What She Said" There was a bizarre interview with Gillard government minister Bill Shorten on the Sky News Agenda program today.
