2020-07-15T17:08:00+10:00 : I no longer believe nabs share price willPlummet to 16.xx before end of July hence why I bought 6,000 shares @ 17.99 today. I'm anticipating nabs SP to be over $20 a share within 4 weeks. I see challenger cgf challenger jumping $1 within the same time frame hence why I bought 20,000 cgf shares.
