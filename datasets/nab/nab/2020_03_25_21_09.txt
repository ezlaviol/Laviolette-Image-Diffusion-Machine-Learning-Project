So far those trigger points have been set off every 2-3 days.Stage 4 will be non essential retail, non essential industrials with certain work force limits.Stage 5 would see schools and uni goneStage 6 non essential tradeLast stage only food stores, chemist and essential servicesi expect we will spend approx 6 months @ stage 5.However I predict that we will hit max stages for 1 month through the peak around May/June.I am aware that the military is being prepared to start enforcing lock downs.Obviously the purpose of this approach is to keep as many people employed as possible, but also to enable a spread rate that can be handledandthe second purpose isit allows social welfare institution to be hit in drips and drabs as opposed to a tsunami.Now thatâ€™s our escape plan. But the killer will be in the US, what happens there will have huge ramifications for the rest of the world.
