2021-08-17T10:12:00+10:00 : Your numbers are right. They have almost a full  year to complete the buyback however, not 90 days.  If there ever was an appropriate place to say this, the buyback is not a race.

The purpose of the buyback is not to support the share price yet, Goldman on the face of it pushed the price up to its high of 27.80 yesterday. Contrast this with ANZ. While its buyback operated as normal, its share price still fell over 2% while NAB went up a couple of cents.

I can only explain the overperformance of NAB vs ANZ by the conduct of the buyback.
