2020-05-20T11:27:00+10:00 : I was going to take up the SPP thinking free money and so on, however the opportunity cost involved in terms of risk vs reward got me thinking is it worth it? Not much discussion surrounding this. NAB won't fold, but I think the recession and it's effects will be long and lingering. My viewpoint is long term too, however are there better opportunities than this now and in the pipeline?Tying up a big chunk of capital for 5-10 years with perhaps no capital gain for a long time and reduced dividends  has got me thinking. I still haven't made up my mind although leaning on the nay side. Any feedback would be welcome.
