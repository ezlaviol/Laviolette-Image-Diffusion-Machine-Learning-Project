2021-02-06T19:00:00+11:00 : True, but in the last few years if I'm not mistaken, the financial arrangements between BEN and aspirant/existing community banks have become somewhat more onerous.  My impression is they are more weighted in favour of the listed bank,not the locally 'licensed' versions if one can use that term. I'm not a shareholder in BEN but am in NAB.  Rural branches can be important for older folk plus as a 'shop window' to convince those in agribusiness to go with NAB not a competitor.  Farms can be reasonably sized businesses especially given the ongoing trend of rural landholding consolidation. Federal MPs are not Luddites but closing bank branches is like waving a red rag in front of an Angus bull.
