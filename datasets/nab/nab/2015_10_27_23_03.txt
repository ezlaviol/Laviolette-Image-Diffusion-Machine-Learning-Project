2015-10-27T23:03:00+11:00 : There will be a profit of about $6.2 billion and compared to last years $5.2 billion, that is a tidy position. Thorburn is doing a great job, and like he said he would do, he is trimming the non core businesses and the less profitable aspects in a timely and organised manner.

He is the best CEO the company has had in eons. The capital raising already saw to it that the Apra tier requirements are already met. This sale is cream. With the Clydesdale offshoot coming soon,, and then the reimbursement of the money left for Clydesdale payouts still to come in the near distant future, I'm very happy with this guy's performance.
