2020-04-27T23:32:00+10:00 : Really, were the immigrants and their impoverished situation the reason why NAB’s profits fell? whether temporary immigrants or Not?I think it was bad management decisions, Ross McEwan and Simon McKeon showing the same leadership they did at RBS and AMP respectively.RBS and AMP are only now starting to look forward, their gain has been NAB’s loss.You could blame Australia’s excessive out of control and poorly skilled immigration program for a lot of things, say Climate change, congestion, bushfires, crime and disorder, low wage growth, unemployment but I think it is a fair stretch to say the poor NAB result is another one Australia should be blaming on the immigrants?To my mind, NAB holders should blame management and the Board, McEwan and McKeon, not the immigrants no matter how bad and how sinister those immigrants might possibly be. I do not believe the poorly adjusted immigrants are one of the main reasons for NAB’s troubles.
