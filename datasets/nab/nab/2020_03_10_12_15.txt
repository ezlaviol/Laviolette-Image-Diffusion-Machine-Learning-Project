And for the record I think the hybrids come at the bottom of the pile for safety. Anyway, the big banks know how to run their businesses for a profit (watch all the comments come crawling out of the woodwork on that point) - they've always paid well and will continue to do so. Even at $20 SP and paying 60c per half that is 6% return and 8.4% grossed up. So disregard the downramping on Livewire et al. They have their agendas.
