Thats like me saying, look at Boral today.Now if you had prepared an index of all brick makers or large construction companies throughout Australia and that index was smashed 10% then I would say your argument had some weight.Lendlease Group is supposedly the largest construction company in Australia per google. Over the last year it has gone from ~$20 down to nearly $11 but is back at nearly $13. I am not sure the extent of shares this has happened to but I know the lithium market and bank sectors have also had this hit and came back somewhat. What research do you have that supports a further retrenchment from these large falls that have already occurred?Or are you simply making a bear market statement because the market already has that outlook?Cheers
