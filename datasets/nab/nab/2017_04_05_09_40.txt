2017-04-05T09:40:00+10:00 : (Adds APRA chief's comments, background, industry context)  	Australia's banking watchdog  said on Wednesday that authorities can and will take further  action if needed to stop a debt-fuelled bubble in the country's  red-hot housing market.   	Wayne Byres, chairman of the Australian Prudential  Regulatory Authority (APRA), said measures announced last week  were aimed at promoting prudent lending and borrowing practices,  and not to determine housing prices.  	Last week, APRA asked banks to limit new interest-only  lending to 30 percent of total new residential mortgage lending,  from 40 percent now. It also demanded that banks limit investor  credit to "comfortably remain below" a previously set cap of 10  percent annual growth.		In Sydney, prices are rising at almost 20 percent a year,  having more than doubled since 2008, and in Melbourne, the pace  is nearly 16 percent, according to property consultant Core  Logic.		"This latest step is a tactical response to current market  conditions - we can and will do more, or less, as conditions  evolve," he said at an industry conference in Sydney.  	"Our role in the current environment is to promote a  higher-than-normal degree of prudence - definitely by lenders  and, ideally, also borrowers - in both credit decisions and  balance sheet strength."  	On Tuesday, the head of Australia's central bank said  addressing supply-side issues would go a long way in cooling the  sizzling housing market.	 	Australia's corporate watchdog on Monday introduced a new  round of industry surveillance to ensure banks and brokers were  not recommending overly expensive interest-only loans to  customers.		The measures come as regulators grow increasingly worried  about a run-up in borrowing at a time when household debt is  already at record highs, risking a damaging pullback in home  prices.
