2020-07-23T10:41:00+10:00 : You have to bear in mind that volumes are significantly down in property sales, especially in Melbourne and (though not acquainted as well with it) Sydney.So if prices haven't 'collapsed', that may partly be a reflection as to how there's fewer homes available for sale.The apartments market in the two largest cities is under even more pressure.I don't know how many rented properties in total there are in Melbourne or Victoria but one media report suggested Melbourne now has 18,000 vacant rental properties, apparently a high number and presumably well above equilibrium.Banks like NAB are having individual conversations with borrowers.  We know from past economic problem years that banks in Oz prefer to avoid mortgagee sales, but I doubt I'm alone in believing that even though JobKeeper is being extended (at a lower rate) and JobSeeker payments will become higher than the old Newstart, some properties will have to be sold on market if people cannot meet the repayments and have become significantly behind since the pandemic commenced.
