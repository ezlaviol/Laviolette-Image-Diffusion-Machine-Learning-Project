....NAB’s 6% fully-franked dividend makes it impossible not to mention here.  There aren’t many top companies on the ASX that can match the big banks on yield, and I believe they will continue to reward income investors for the foreseeable future. The banking sector reported strongly during the recent earnings season and investor confidence in the Big 4 has returned. NAB in particular has performed well and its share price is up more than 20% in the last 12 months.
