2020-05-20T20:16:00+10:00 : Those sub 100 holdings are probably still on the register for the very purpose of taking advantage of SPP's like this one, with minimal risk and outlay  I'd be surprised if a majority chose not to participate with even a minimum $5k outlay. $15.60 vs $14.15 is roughly 10% difference. On a $5000 investment, that's an instant $500 profit. Who doesn't want $500 free money? And I would be willing to bet a lot more will be applying for the full $30k which would deliver a lot more profit than a $5k investment. And it's so easy nowadays to apply for SPP shares - no need to write a cheque, fill out some forms, and post it in the mail, it can all be done over the internet. I must have spent no more than 5 minutes applying for my NAB SPP shares this time around.  I'll be pleasantly surprised if there's a limited or even no scaleback, as I've applied for $30k, but I'm not expecting it.
