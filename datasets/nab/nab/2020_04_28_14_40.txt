Good luck with the raising, I can only hope that NAB management snap out of vicious cycles of poor management, bad acquisitions and bad behaviour that leave shareholders to clean up the mess time and again. To be sure I'm not advocating for no banking exposure or no NAB exposure per se, but rather want to highlight that NAB is by far not the only company that one can invest in for income. I know people who have devoted their entire wealth to NAB (or another bank) which I think is extremely poor, dangerous and cult-like behaviour.
