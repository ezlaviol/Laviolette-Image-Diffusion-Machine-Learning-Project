2018-12-04T11:02:00+11:00 : I dont think this is the case, I think many buyers from$23.33or whatever it was have been selling it at $25.00. NAB dropped so much it created so many retail investors to buy and now are creating a line in the sand that technical analyst call resistance.So once they are all out of the picture (retail investors) or enough of them anyway. The Big guys are just buying now, imagine seeing NAB the only stock not going up as much and buying it knowing it will go up with the others eventually.This is my opinion I could be wrong but would love some thought on it.
