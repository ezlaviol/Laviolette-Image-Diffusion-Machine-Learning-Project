Realistically NAB have been tracking sideways for years along with the other banks (in terms of share price) so why should the executive pay continue to increase? I'm a big fan of executives being paid in shares and think we are going to see a lot more of this going forward. Can anyone see a catalyst that might get the banks out of their holding pattern? They've basically turned into "utility" style shares since they've shrunk and derisked.
