2019-02-20T15:02:00+11:00 : Good day PE. My point was the ann says very clearly the guy resigned. Early. His call. Not terminated. No shock/horror. So I can't figure why NAB has to shell out except to say that his contract was so badly drawn up that it included this 'entitlement'. Otherwise lets call a spade a spade, and agree the bloke was terminated (incompetence/unable to manage transition/loss of confidence by the Board/whatever). This sort of stuff only adds to our scepticism about the Board's ability to successfully oversee the recruitment of a CEO, manage his/her remuneration and then replace the Chair.
