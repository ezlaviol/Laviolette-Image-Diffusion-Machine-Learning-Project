2019-11-20T16:25:00+11:00 : Nov 20 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd  (NAB)  on Wednesday said it reached a A$49.5-million ($33.74-million) settlement for a class action lawsuit over the sale of worthless insurance policies to customers for their credit cards. 	 The class action was filed by law firm Slater & Gordon  (SGH)  last year.   	 "NAB no longer sells Consumer Credit Insurance (CCI) products through any of its banking channels, and has implemented a remediation program," said Sharon Cook, the bank's chief legal and commercial counsel. 	In a statement, NAB said the payment was pending approval from the Federal Court, but it had made provision for the amount in its financial statements for fiscal 2019.  ($1=1.4671 Australian dollars)
