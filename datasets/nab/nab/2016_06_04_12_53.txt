2016-06-04T12:53:00+10:00 : IMO the more important question for me as a dividend investor is do I think the price of NAB will be significantly higher or lower over the next 5 months until next div. I don't think it will be catastrophically lower but I will be looking for better prices than $26 in that term. Unless I plan to trade the stock rather than invest for dividends, buying at current prices is worse than having money sitting in the bank at horribly low rates. 5 months is a long time on the market and having some patience is well worth the rewards. Has taken me many years to learn how valuable patience is. I doubt $26 will be anything close to the low over the next 5 months. I'd like to think breaking $24 is possible with global trends. I won't be investing anything until the sp gets into the $25 range. I'm sure there will be some resistance at $26 but I'm happy to watch and wait.
Come on down NAB
