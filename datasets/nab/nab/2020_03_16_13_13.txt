2020-03-16T13:13:00+11:00 : It is a battle of BOTS trades (Algo Trades). That's why massive swings are there as there are Panic Seller and Panic Buyers ..One should know how to swim during " High Tide ". Anchor , Anchor and Anchor (means do no trade what so ever)... Any body trying to trade in a highly volatile market, it a licence to loose big money as one does not know what price it will open or close.
