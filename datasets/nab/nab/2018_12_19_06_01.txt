2018-12-19T06:01:00+11:00 : At yesterday's closing NAB sp (52 week/6 years? low) and if they continue to pay annual div of $1.98cts, their yield is 8.5+% without any franking credits.......as I posted in another thread one of the largest market cap banks in other markets are trading close to or at 52 weeks lows eg: JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, HSBC, Royal Bank of Canada, UBS and including China's largest banks.  Something is "brewing" in the banking sector or the whole financial system will be going through a "day of reckoning"/collapse?
