I strongly suspect that most of it has already been factored into the share price.

There has been some discussion in the financial media and the institutional investment fraternity about NAB's payout ratio being too high, so I would not be surprise if - besides some initial modest sticker shock manifesting in early trading today - the stock price ends up being not much changed from its current level in the days/weeks ahead.

After all, even if the final dividend is also reduced in the same manner, that would result in the re-based dividend being $1.66cps.... equivalent to a fully-franked dividend yield of 6.4%.

Which, in the context of the yield on offer from other fixed income security proxies, is quite appealing.
