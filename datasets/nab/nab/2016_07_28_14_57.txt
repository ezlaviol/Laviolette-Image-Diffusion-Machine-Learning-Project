my thought are similar to yours

in my opinion the resources like bhp,rio,fmg have run to hard to get in now

the like of cba are too high in my opinion so it doesn't leave many other blue chips for me personally

im focusing on nab, but im a bit iffy about that, I made some good money from the run from 24ish to now, so im considering that if it has a pullback to say 25ish but not holding my breath, however it does have potential fir say 28ish running to the next div but I would rather play it safe and wait for a bit of a pull back on it.

subsequently im keen to perhaps jump in on boq??? im hoping there may be a pullback to low 10s before I jump in but this may not happen, it may hold here before a trend up.
