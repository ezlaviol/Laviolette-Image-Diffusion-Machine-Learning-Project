Depending on market stability sometimes I will sell @ a loss but if you include the divi and franking credits there is a profit greater than just parking the money. Most of the time you will make a small capital gain which effectively lowers your core holding purchase price, plus the divi of course. It really depends on what you are trying to achieve and your personal tax situation. A blue chip can run into hard times also eg BHP. The stock market is littered with them.
