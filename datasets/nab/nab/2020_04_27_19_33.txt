2020-04-27T19:33:00+10:00 : Now, now! I'm sure things aren't that bad! Tsk, tsk!I just received a nice email from a man who runs a bank, and he said the following (in part):"It is very clear our customers, both personal and business, are feeling the pain of the impact of COVID-19 and now our shareholders are feeling this as well. With this in mind, the Board and senior management have decided to cut elements of their remuneration. The Chairman and each of the Directors will forego 20 per cent of their base fees for the second half of NAB's financial year, from 1 ‌April to 30 ‌September. The Group CEO will also reduce his base remuneration by 20 per cent over the same period. In addition, the Group CEO and Executive Leadership Team have decided that they will not be awarded any short-term variable reward for the 2020 financial year."Now, last half-year I received a dividend of 83 cents.Next dividend I receive will be 30 cents.That's a reduction of 53 cents, or about 64%.The Board and senior management (in other words; the ones responsible for the bank's position), are cutting their remuneration by 20%.Me: No responsibility in running of bank:                     64% cut.Them: Full responsibility in running of bank:               20% cut.That sounds fair, doesn't it?
