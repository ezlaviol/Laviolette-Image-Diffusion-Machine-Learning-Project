The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) added more than 100 new claims against Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (CBA) for failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws, including late reporting of attempts to wire money as recently as August by an individual convicted of terror-related offences.

Real estate stocks also piled on losses as investors took profits.  	Westfield Corp (WFD) dropped 1.5 percent for a second day of losses after it posted a record percentage gain on Wednesday. The company's shares had surged on news it would accept a $16 billion takeover offer from Unibail-Rodamco.  	Conversely, industrial stocks were among the highest percentage gainers on the benchmark.
