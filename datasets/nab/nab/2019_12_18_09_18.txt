The fact that many of these misdeeds by the bank's are now subject to remediation payments at considerable cost to all banks and their shareholders obviously must mitigate the level of eventual penalty imposed.
In my opinion it would be far better for the regulators to go after individuals responsible for those areas and ensure penalties are imposed for derelection of duty.
This would appear a logical move given these people are paid the big bucks because of the considerable "responsibility" they apparently have
It might also have the effect of actually creating change and ensuring these Companies are getting what they are paying for from their executive people!!
