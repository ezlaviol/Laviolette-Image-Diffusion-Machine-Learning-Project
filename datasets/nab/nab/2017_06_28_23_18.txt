But even then there is a right and wrong price. To me everything carries some risk. Even if that risk is low. I would sooner miss an opportunity if the price is not right. Than to chase simply for the fear of missing out. Right now NAB is to expensive for me. If that means I miss out. then so be it. There will always be another opportunity out there somewhere.
