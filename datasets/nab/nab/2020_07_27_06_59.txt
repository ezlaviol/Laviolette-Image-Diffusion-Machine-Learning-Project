Be interesting to see what transpires in 2021 and probably more accurately, the first six months of 2021.Record low interest rates won't impact that much if people are worries about their own employment issues - but it could bring into the market cashed up investors if housing prices dip.If housing prices dip significantly then bank SP's will remain subdued for a while.

Could happen for sure. I believe Macquarie Bank's Annual Report alludes to Real Estate taking approx. 6 months to even start to show accurate market corrections/adjustments.. any property data experts in the house?It feels like the Australian Property market may be headed for a cliff, however, I'm surprised by it's resilience thus far.Would love to know more. All seems incredibly unjustifiably over-valued, given current economic outlook.
