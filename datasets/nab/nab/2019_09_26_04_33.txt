There was a change made to the calculation of the dividend which set a lower percentage of profits to be distributed to SH last time around - which reduced the dividend from 99 cents to 83 cents. Not sure whether it would be accurate to call it a one off - maybe a starting point perhaps.Assuming that profits are similar or marginally higher then maybe 83-85 cents could be a reasonable call for the next dividend. I personally think it would probably be an increasing value over time.

So the last dividend of 83c was a one off in your opinion?
