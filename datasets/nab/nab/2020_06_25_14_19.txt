This market is totally crazy with so called unchartered water. It's the big money who are stiring the murkey water, so even the most experienced traders on HC frequently lost their games.One thing can be confident is that no one has clear vison of valuation on banks currently. If the economy are to stay in bog for years (certainly possible), bad debts will abrupt, dividend will go to zero, there will be no reason to support current SP. Only the otherhand, if economy outcome is not as bad, or governments decide to continue to flood the markets with fiat paper, any asset will be valued much higher. It's up to each person's financial position and risk appetite so to speak.In short term, it's the big money's game. There is an ancient Chinese fable, an marshal clenched his fists and asked his assistant: "I have a cricket in my hand, can you guess it's live or dead?" Well, I guess this is what big money doing to the HC smarties. You can't out play the big money in short term.
