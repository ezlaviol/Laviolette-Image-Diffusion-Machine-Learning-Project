2019-03-19T10:42:00+11:00 : Have to admit at being somewhat perplexed about the stubborn resolve of the nAB SP to sit around the $25 mark - mixed bag for the banks in early trade today with NAB and CBA down and ANZ and Westpac up - Westpac up almost 1%.In my humble view, NAB is doing just as well as the other banks - and I have held shares for a few years now as I do believe it is the one bank that holds very good potential regarding return and capital value. I see nothing about their position that warrants any concerns and nothing on the horizon either. Real estate downturn is "soft" and not something that will sink any banks fortunes. The royal commission will have limited impact - except for some great headlines.If anyone has some insights as to why the current situation exists then I would really like that input.
