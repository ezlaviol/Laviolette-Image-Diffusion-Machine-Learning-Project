Ex holder and planning to become a future holder - and to be honest, I would prefer the SP to go down and not up because I wish to buy back in. Pumping it makes little sense then doesn't it? I am very sincere in liking NAB - it is going to me a mainstay in my SMSF. I just need the ducks to line up in my other investments to return to being a NAB shareholder

Why pumping this stock every day if you don't held NAB @Footmax ?
