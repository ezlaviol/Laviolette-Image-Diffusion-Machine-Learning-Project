So I will probably sell my 'speculative' parcel of NAB shares after it goes ex div next week.  Despite the price drop that I expect will come when they go ex div, I am better off having the dividend income than having capital gain.  Hopefully it'll be the same number of dollars, but in different 'baskets' for tax purposes.  I still hold a large parcel in my SMSF which is a 'buy & hold', for dividend income in my (hopefully soon) retirement. So I'm hoping for a return to earlier divi levels,Flip
