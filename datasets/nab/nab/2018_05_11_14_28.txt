2018-05-11T14:28:00+10:00 : I very much doubt that NAB will drop it's dividend below $1.98. The sentiment will change so much more for the worse that a collapse in SP of even 20% is possible if that were to occur.
The board will be cognisant of this and will avoid it at all costs.
The SP has been below $25 not that long ago and then climbed to $34 in less than one year later.
