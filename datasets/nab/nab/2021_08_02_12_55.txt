2021-08-02T12:55:00+10:00 : Your comparing NAB 1999 (pre dot.com bubble) to NAB now just after a global pandemic.Please give me another bank share price, perhaps Commonwealth Bank?1999 - $222021 - $100 or Perhaps ANZ1999 - $102021 - $28NAB has always had a relatively high dividend yielded stock so comparing a high yielding stock (that doesnt retain much earnings for growth) during a boom period in the past. In comparison to a market glut atm is just being a "silly sausage".In a few years time when COVID is a page in history, and the interest rates rise as they do in any economic up turn, and banks are making a killing on all these overpriced over demanded home loans, you will be scratching your head at why you didnt buy them FOR capital growth.
