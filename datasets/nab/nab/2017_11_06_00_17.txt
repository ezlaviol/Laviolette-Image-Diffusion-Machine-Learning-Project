2017-11-06T00:17:00+11:00 : But BOQ was already overbought when the slide came, the BOQ results happened when BOQ was at a plateau. NAB is at quite a high and is quite overbought compared to its $29.90 resistance.

BOQ is a regional, NAB is a major. Both are probably a bit toppy in SP. If NAB is worth $31.79, my RIE stripping out MLC vs OnePath, CFS/ CommInsure and BTFG is ANZ = $35, CBA= $87, WBC =$34.50 compared with NAB = $30. Aâ€™s for BOQ well if it is worth $12.50 then BEn should be about $13.45 and the majors should be rated a little higher IMHO but pls DYOR.

But SPs have often no reflection to valuation reality, that is why we humans have so much fun in the game and why the computers have always got it so wrong. It is also why everyone will miss the next correction.

Exciting times ahead for HOT, NAB and BOQ and all their other competitors IMHO but pls DYOR.
