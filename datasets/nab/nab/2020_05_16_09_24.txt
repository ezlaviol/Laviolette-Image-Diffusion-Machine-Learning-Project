Banks shares in general may take 12 months to start being what they have always been - secure shares with excellent returns and a growing capital value. Sitting on them (and accumulating) at current prices is a good investment for the future.I sold mine for sure - to chase other opportunities - but I will certainly be back holding NAB later in the year. There will be headwinds for all banks in that time but they will dissipate over time.For all those holding - great work and you will get your rewards for doing so.
