2020-05-26T15:50:00+10:00 : I beg to differ Hanofee.If two shareholders with vastly different holdings both apply for $30k of shares and there is a scale back.  Both will get the same number of shares under the SPP.  This is the case with this recent NAB SPP.You may be thinking of a pro-rata entitlement offer SPP.  The bigger guy will be able to apply for more shares and on scale back will of course get more than the little guy. You know what I mean....?
