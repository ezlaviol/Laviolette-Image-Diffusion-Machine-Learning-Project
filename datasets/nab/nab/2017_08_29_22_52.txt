2017-08-29T22:52:00+10:00 : Apart from ANZ, none of the other big four, or BOQ and BEN for that matter have cut their dividend. CBA has slightly increased it. ANZ cut seemed to be related to the restructuring required when they pulled out of their failed Asian ventures. All financial reports from NAB so far have been satisfactory, so no, I don't think NAB will cut their dividend.
