2016-06-01T13:58:00+10:00 : Hehe. I had to learn the hard way myself. Am I thinking about the best price today or what I should be thinking about. The best price over 6 months. I've bought NAB in the past @34 so don't feel bad about it. Get out of the daily price and look at it from a 6 monthly price. Is this the best price you think you will get in the next 5 months? If not hold off. I was almost buying at >25 ANZ but I held off simply because it's 5 months before the next div and unless I think I can buy/sell within that timeframe for a profit, then my money is better off in the bank @2% unless I'm trading other stocks.

Anyway. Smack on the wrist
