I am perplexed as to where this number is derived from from? is this some kind of constant? super cool thanks for sharing with mere mortals of mathematics such as squirrel. I get the 1.66 as this would be the sum of the bilateral dividend.  Having a guess that the 1.4285 has something to do with the corporate tax? rate but it's a guess.  Enlighten us oh mighty Foot dude.
