So the other side of the fence.And during the day I follow George Conway's twitter feed for a lot of head shaking at the hopelessness of their system.I find there is no in between between the 45% on foxnews Koolaid and the other 55%, and how mush they despise each other.But I am worried about New York, St Louis, Mississippi and Florida.
