2020-04-27T10:05:00+10:00 : IIRC the GFC era capital raising was at $21.50. Think I got 200 or so shares and sold them at high 27s on issue and banked $1,200 off the bat. This is one of the reasons I like bear markets, lots of opportunities for quick trades or money to bank. All in all this result wasn't terrible. Buying more shares at $14.15 may turn out to be a good opportunity.To the comments the banks have lagged since the GFC, fair call, no-one can argue it would have been better to buy FAANG stocks over the same period. And I do have some of those companies. However, I think there is room for financials in a well diversified portfolio. Yes, it's not particularly pretty at the moment. Who knows what it will look like in 12 months from now.
