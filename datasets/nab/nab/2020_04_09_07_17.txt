Theoretically if the interest rate is very low, then just paying interest accruing and not capital should not be too hard a stretch for most.  However, what effect will the dampening if the economy make on businesses on the recovery side.For example:  If a cafe is allowed to reopen next  month but under social distancing conditions.  Only half as many tables.Income will be less, overheads will be the same.  If they raise prices people who have lost jobs etc will not be able to eat there anyway.The flow on effects and multiplier effect if enormous.  My opinion only
