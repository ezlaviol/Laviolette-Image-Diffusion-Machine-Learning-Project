Not sure when the banks will be above $30 again, for that Australia will need the virus to disappear and some good economic certainty, I should imagine that could be as long as four years away. What you have got wrong is the bottom (or what we think has been the bottom) which came mid March at $14. I noted you have a BUY at $22 so therefore the banks recent prices should have you gobbling them up with a vengeance. The banks will be back. To suggest otherwise is to say the Australian economy will never be back. I think as dividend investors we have an unprecedented opportunity for at least the next 30 months to accumulate at these unusually low levels.
