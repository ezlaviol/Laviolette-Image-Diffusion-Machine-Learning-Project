2015-11-04T15:01:00+11:00 : Because it had a better quality profit result than NAB (from lending to buyers of overpriced residential property in Sydney and Melbourne...tongue in cheek) ? I think both NAB and ANZ are suffering from their stronger representation in business banking where margins are under pressure and credit growth has been lame. WBC and CBA which are collectively the biggest lenders to home onwers as opposed to businesses, have done well, remarkably gapping up beyond yesterday's prices, while NAB and ANZ are struggling to stay green.
