Josh Frydenberg would be well aware that our Bank's get most of their funding from offshore sources, so the RBA rate has relevance to them mainly in the pricing of what they pay investors.  The investors funds that are on-lent into the home loan sector are the only bit that they can price lower.  The way I see it, for example is, if they are borrowing 60% of their funds offshore, 10% from their own reserves & 30% from investors, they can really only be expected to pass on 30% of the RBA rate reduction.  This is only an example, I don't know the actual percentage break up, but I hope this clarifies the position for some.Full disclosure - I'm an ex CommBank Manager of 26 years.  I always say if you haven't worked for a Bank, you have no right to hate them as much as those who have !!
