I have never suggested one bank is better or worse than the others and I am certainly not trying to advise anyone to buy hold or sell any of the banks. (unlike your profound sentiment changes seemingly based on minute daily movements
I have simply been trying to work out what you are on about??
One minute you are talking about a daily SP movement as some sort of evidence that the market agrees with you then you keep repeating that "based on evidence" you consider ANZ & WBC to be more "digitally able" than CBA & NAB!! 
You have repeatedly been asked for this evidence and you keep deflecting. You have finally admitted in above post that you have no knowledge whatsoever about WBC & ANZ "digital ability" which apparently means, to you, they are better
(Appears all you have is anecdotal evidence that CBA is bad!!)
For some reason you also seem to be completely ignoring WBC's Austrac issues
I am not or have not made any claims that any of the banks are more "digitally able" than the others as I don't know - hence why I was curious about this special knowledge you have.
(I do use Nabtrade and see no evidence of it being down more than others - in fact it is rarely down)
Anyway, I will leave you to your thought bubbles.............
