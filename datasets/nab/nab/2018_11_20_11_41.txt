The RC is only part of the story and bank stocks are also down due to macro events coupled with an uncertain path post RC. They may well bounce back in the short term, however basing an investment decision on the RC ending is fraught. Further regulatory intervention for example will dampen the appetite of many investors.
Hopefully we are near the bottom which always makes any investment look good later (regardless of why), however one of the accepted strategies is to see evidence of a turnaround from the current trend rather than guessing when we are at the bottom!
The banks all survived the GFC, however NAB has never recovered to pre GFC highs so while the banks are a long term play, automatic sustained capital growth should not by thought of as a given.
The whole notion of Blue chips is an oft quoted and misunderstood term. I am sure there are many on here who remember the early nineties when Westpac was a gnats whisker off going under! (now those were good buying opportunities for banks)
Warren Buffet has significant investment in various bank shares, however he is usually particular about the actual Companies and it should not be read as a blanket recommendation of the whole industry.
I am a long term holder in NAB and happy to hold (actually continued buying through DRP which hasn't been so successful in recent years).
The Sp will be supported by the continuing strong dividend so I don't expect there to be too much more downside (but who knows), however the upside may be a somewhat rocky path so while you may end up correct it may well be due to other reasons..........................
