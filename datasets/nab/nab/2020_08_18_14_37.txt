Economy will recover and sooner or later, sanity will return and we will strive to be the best we can be in COVID19 free world. Banks will suffer no doubt but anyone who managed to secure a position at very low average SP over the last few months would have done well. I started buying in just after COVID19 crash and averaged down and my average price is still a bit higher than what I want it to be and yes there are significant headwinds but over 10 to 30 year horizon, it's still a good buy. There is pain ahead. I run a small business so trust me I feel every bit of it. I had to sack my loyal workers and now I am about to renegotiate my mortgage payments to reduce stress but I still believe buying big 4 bank shares and ride the recovery period over next 5 years or so is not a bad investment move to make.
