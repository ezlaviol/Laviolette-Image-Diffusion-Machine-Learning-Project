Sounds like a decent amount. I think right now I would rather be holding BOQ than some of my tragic stocks. Anyway, as you said life is full of should have, could have but didn't! By the end of august it will be make or break time for most of them so at least I will know where they stand. I hope it's not , but I think I will be glad to know regardless as simply waiting to see what Mrs Market thinks of the next announcement is a bit of a pain in the bum, and I am sick of having cash tied up to a dead horse, when it could have been tied up to a friendly bank (have you seen cyb recently ).
