According to recent reports.  A vaccine will possibly be 9-12 months away and probably longer.I think if we are lucky in 12 months we may get back to 75% of preexisting activity due to small business bankruptcies.  I do not have an idea as to how to judge the impact of printing money or debt to pay for the various packages.I think it will take years for the economy to get back to where it was, and therefore years for share price especially of the banks.The good news, I believe the current actions will be sufficient in Australia to flatten the curve so that the health system is not overwhelmed.  After then the growing rate of people who have not been diagnosed will continue to spread hopefully at not exponential rates and herd immunity will eventually be reached before the vaccine.If people practice social distancing in say infection rate of 3 may drop to 2. With every 10% infected it will drop by 0.2.  10% equals 1.8.  20% equals 1.6.  The shutdown and social distancing may drop the 3 to 1 and then decrease as the percentage of people get it.In short, I believe the impact is severe.  But I don't think in Australia it is the end of the world and I think the government has down a good job.  But as I have said before the USA will be a basket case and Europe and the UK will also be not far behind.In Australia the health system will hopefully not be overwhelmed.  In those countries the peak will be 5-10 times the capacity.Therefore I am in the long term confident in the Australian banks surviving and increasing but when the USA hits the wall before Easter there will be downward pressure.
