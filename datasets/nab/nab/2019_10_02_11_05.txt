2019-10-02T11:05:00+10:00 : (Adds details of charges to be incurred) 	Oct 2 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd  (NAB)  said on Wednesday it was setting aside an extra A$1.18 billion ($790 million) to help pay back wrongly charged customer fees, nearly double the amount previously estimated, sending its shares sliding. 	The steep charge comes in the wake of a government mandated inquiry into Australia's financial sector, which found rampant misconduct among top institutions. 	Australia's No. 3 lender said it expects the charges to reduce its cash earnings in the second half of fiscal 2019 by around A$1.12 billion after tax. 	The new provisions include A$832 million for additional customer remediation, while A$348 million was incurred after a review of its software capitalisation policies. 	The bank's total provisions for customer-related remediation as of Sept. 30 stood at $2.09 billion, it said in a statement.  	Its shares were trading down 3.1%.		 ($1 = 1.4910 Australian dollars)
