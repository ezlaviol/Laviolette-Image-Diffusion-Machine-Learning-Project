In 1918, some countries had restrictions and confinement and some didnt and the the figures were similar throughout.Sweden is a case in point and pe981, you cant take deaths as a measure because logically deaths cannot be connected to lockdowns, only to confirmed cases.The thing is (and the med experts have not stated this)... the virus knows thatif it kills the human it will also die, its not stupid ,so as time goes on (months) it mutates to a not so deadly formand the epidemic retreats (as it did with the Spanish flu)
