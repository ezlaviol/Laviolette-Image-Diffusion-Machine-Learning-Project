The data will prove or disprove this very soon - once we have large sample of non symptomatic people.Right now we are at the crossroads but will soon know which path to take based on data not guesswork.Personally i am far more optimistic than i was even a few weeks ago.  Not for tourism or live music etc though....  Group events will be changed forever.
