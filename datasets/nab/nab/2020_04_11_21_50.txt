2020-04-11T21:50:00+10:00 : Ive read a lot of articles but no one is taking a punt.Lets say going forward a moderate ill effect on NAB long term from the COVID19 pandemic.Including  interest rates stay where they are and property prices remain relatively stable or drop no further than 10%, unemployment under 10%. That sort of thing. Not at worst but not the best either..Whats the best guesses at NABs bottom line and share price going forward (2021) and likely follow on effect on shareholder distributions.
