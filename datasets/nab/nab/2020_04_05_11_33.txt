Incoming Westpac CEO Peter King sums the Dividend question up perfectly....."Mr King said Westpac's call on dividends, to be made in May, would not be an easy one and banks would make their own decisions according to the circumstances facing them. “A lot of our shareholders are self-funded retirees and they live off the dividend, so it’s not a zero-sum game,” he said.“That’s the fine balance we’ll have to have a look at in early May when we stare into the dividend —between what’s right for the balance sheet and capital perspective, and how do we think about shareholders that live off the dividend?"NAB and CBA will be thinking the exact same thing. (you would hope !!)
