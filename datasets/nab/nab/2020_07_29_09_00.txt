2020-07-29T09:00:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, July 29 (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog on Wednesday eased restrictions around dividends for banks and insurers saying they do not need to continue to defer capital distributions if they can moderate payments to sustainable levels.  	The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) last week said it had plans to update a capital return policy that halted dividend payments by banks because of the coronavirus crisis.
