2017-11-06T22:37:00+11:00 : yes well aware of fmg discount, however they are still making good money, as I write dalian iron ore on a bit of a tear today, what if spot iron ore hits 70-80 bucks a ton again, the discount will mean bugger all to fmg they will make sheet loads when their all in cost is like around 29 bucks a ton.

also fmg has just announced that they are selling their ore to other countries to compensate for the current china discount which might I add this discount can change very suddenly once pollution restrictions are relaxed, we all know how china works, we all wake up tomorrow and bang china are full steam ahead again and not concerned about pollution for a few months.

fmg also now exploring/drilling for lithium

fmg balance sheet rock solid

chance of massive short squeeze, shorts have to buy back eventually

div may be lower however they have guaranteed a 50-80% payout ratio

it will be too late once the discount turns in my opinion, it will be a 6.50 dollar stock by then possibly.

banks in my opinion have nothing but headwinds, their growth is very limited, over inflated property markets in Sydney and Melbourne may cause issues for banks, banks also under huge regulatory headwinds, yes they will continue to provide yield but at what cost to capital.

this is the way I look at the banks, this is a really simplistic analysis

ask yourself this, if you owned a business or even work for a business, what is the first and easiest and quickest thing you do when your business is struggling and you need to stem the bleeding, you sack staff.

NAB cutting 6000 staff, I say again 6000 staff, that to me is a freeway of alarm bells ringing saying hey we are struggling here????

last time I checked, fmg wasn't cutting staff
