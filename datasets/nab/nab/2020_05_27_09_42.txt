I am really disappointed with the complete lack of detail of how they are going to calculate the scale-back. I mean they now know how many applicants took up the offer and the dollar amount. So much for sweeping out the board when the new board cant even include the calculation they are going to use like every other company does on the day. Its a weak pi$$ poor effort and we deserve better than this. Does not fill me with confidence in them outperforming when they cant even get the no brainer simple stuff right in a timely manner.
