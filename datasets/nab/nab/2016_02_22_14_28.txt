2016-02-22T14:28:00+11:00 : the sp still seems to be at the mercy of the market and overall economy doubts.
that p/e ratio is tasty tho if nab do manage to keep profit coming in and the same dividend's through all the so called headwinds then I wont regret anything in the future that's for sure. The dividends alone in one year will fill the gap on any losses i may occur this year so far.
through all the doom and gloom 2016 has had so far their still might be a light at the end of the tunnel.
