2020-06-16T12:50:00+10:00 : CFD trading is massively more expensive than normal trading. I only pay $9.50 total maximum price to buy or sell $200,000 worth of shares at any one time. I'm all about quick short term cash opportunities. not just in the share market either. if I see an item advertised too cheaply I'll buy it just to resell it for a quick turn around profit.  this can be anything in size from a coin to a caravan.
