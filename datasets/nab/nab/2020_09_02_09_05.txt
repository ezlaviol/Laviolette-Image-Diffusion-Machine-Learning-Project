2020-09-02T09:05:00+10:00 : I agree it is not a nice 10 year chart.If you knew in 2010 that it would trend that way, you would not buy then for growth in stock value.But now, this has been oversold IMHO.The company has increased it's cash strength, and is simplifying the business with the sale of MLC. Moody's have downramped the banks but NAB has expenses well under control and factored in all risk costs associated with bad loans.I am bullish on NAB and started buying in March. I will continue to build my stake while the price is low. I see a return to full dividends in 2022 and a share price in the low to mid 20s.This is a clear buy.My opinion only.
