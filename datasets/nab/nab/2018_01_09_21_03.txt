Me and my friends joke it’s better to have a sex change and claim your trans for an executive promotion. Fills several useless quotas. Promotions should be based on merit, no gender, race or sexual orientation.

At the end of the day tech will take even more jobs, and robots are non binary so all quotas are filled. Lol
