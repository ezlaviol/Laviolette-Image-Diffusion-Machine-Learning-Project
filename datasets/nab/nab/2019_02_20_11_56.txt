But that's living in fairy land and even if the bod sacked him they would, without a doubt, have to make some sort of payment whether by agreement or through contract litigation. 
Unfortunately even in small business it is a fact of life that you normally have to cough up to get rid of someone, unless the reasons are of a fraudulent / criminal nature or the like and this is more about reputational issues and being able to convey change.
