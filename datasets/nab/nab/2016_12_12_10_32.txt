2016-12-12T10:32:00+11:00 : NAB just traded for $30. There's significant volume to push through at this level which seems to be selling or being withdrawn. I note it's not far off 52 week highs now either.

Pretty much anyone trading this in the past year would have made money.

Well done management for executing their strategy over the past couple of years when it was beat up and out of favour.
