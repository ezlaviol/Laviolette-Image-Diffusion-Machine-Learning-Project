2016-06-14T15:24:00+10:00 : BOQ 10.6 very nice buy. 20c off the 52 week low and a much better entry than mine. Have another bid in on Ben @9 but unlikely to get hit at least today. A lot of support at 9. Just came back from Tewantin and all the banks were there except BOQ which is just down the road in Noosa. As I walked past them I called out, get back to work! Classy
