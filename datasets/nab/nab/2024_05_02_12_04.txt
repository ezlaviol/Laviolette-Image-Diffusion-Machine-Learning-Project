And they have a history of doing similar things before this latest example. I don't think the buyback is in the "long term good". I think its evidence that the bank is run by reactive managers rather than forward thinking leaders.  And thats being kind. If i was unkind i would say its evidence of incompetence since these people running the bank are paid huge salaries because of their so called banking expertise yet they cant get basic things like that right. I'm getting out i am just glad the price has gone up enough for me to sell at a good profit.
