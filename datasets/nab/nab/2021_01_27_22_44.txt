Its pretty simple.Public listed companies = maximise profit for shareholders = cut costs = cut/reduce staff = overwork staff to make up the difference = issues, mistakes and lack of quality control/checks.Don't forget once growth/revenue slows down (banks are experiencing this, as they are mature businesses), the only way to keep shareholders happy is.. cut costs to improve profitability.Its a catch 22, you wouldn't be happy with rising costs, but then you arent happy with issues being found.
