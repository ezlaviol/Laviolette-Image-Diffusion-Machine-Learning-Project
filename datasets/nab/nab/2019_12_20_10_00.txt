Why are we focusing on Banks as a topic, it should be about NAB purely and simply . Its a fact that from the Ceo down there has been a lack of concerted effort to reign in the wrong doings of certain staff within their organisation, to me it appears that the focus over the years was on expansion, be it overseas ( UK ) or Life products (MLC) all these whilst they appear to benefit the share holders, they have in fact backfired and caused some considerable damage to the basic core  business, which is Banking in Australia.Therefore please start to focus on the customer andtreat your share holders with more respect or the next year will be repeat of 2019 fiasco. .
