2016-04-04T13:07:00+10:00 : I'll try to get a copy. SP up 1.5% so far today and slightly better than the other big 4 banks. I looked at ANZ and declined. It (ANZ) appears cheaper but have read that factories in China are not being paid for goods bought months ago. They are owed record amounts and seem to have ltd recourse to get paid. If a factory in China can't get paid what chance then does a bank in Oz? Hence, i plumbed for NAB.
