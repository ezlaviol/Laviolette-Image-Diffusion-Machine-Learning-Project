2020-05-27T12:19:00+10:00 : The pro-rata entitlement is approx 1 new share for every 10 held on the record date. Minimum allocation 176 shares. The 2% who don’t get their pro-rata entitlement are retail holders who have say 50000 shares. The pro-rata would be approx 5000 shares but because it’s capped at $30k worth they only get around 2000 shares.It is a bit confusing.
