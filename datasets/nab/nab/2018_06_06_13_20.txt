2018-06-06T13:20:00+10:00 : Some abstracts from NAB recent report ?
..
NAB is cutting 6000 jobs over the next three years (including via natural attrition) 
..
 6,000 staff to be made redundant.  It showed 521 were made redundant end of March and a further 531 exited in April. Means out of 6000, 1100 already gone, means they are removing almost 1100 people in 4 months. 
..
Forget 3 years, with this speed NAB will remove entire 6000 staff within a year.
..
.... Seems NAB is on trek to get rid off 6,000 staff with in a year plus soon MLC will offloaded.
..
NAB only hired 93 new staff in the first half on 2018
