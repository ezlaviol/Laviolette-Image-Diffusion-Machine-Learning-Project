2020-04-27T11:04:00+10:00 : NAB shareholders need to look closely at the numbers. Whilst cash earnings have fallen they still make a sh.t load of profits and of course need to make provisions for bad loans etc. The raising will give NAB an impressive buffer going forward, note that NIM has largely remained in tact.A 30 cent dividend is still more than 4% FF. Note also that the payout ratio is very low, and dividends may increase on the other side of this crisis.I will add to my holdings in the SPP, and like my experience in buying bank shares during the GFC will most likely see increased capital gains and rising dividends when Global recovery occurs into the middle of this decade. But donâ€™t expect quick profits here, this is a long term investment.DYOR
