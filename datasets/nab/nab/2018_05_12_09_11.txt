ANZ and Wbc was better. Cba the worst IMO. Regardless all are cheap notwithstanding a housing crash. WBC would be the worst, followed by CBA in such a scenario. 

I hold all 4 so don’t care tbh. All 4 will be around well after we’ve passed on from the world. Buy when others are in fear. I’ll pick up another 2,000 shares on ex dividend over the next week for the mother’s SMSF. I’m out of investable cash unless I sell something.
