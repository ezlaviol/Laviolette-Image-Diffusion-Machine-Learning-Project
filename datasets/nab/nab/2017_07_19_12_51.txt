Why the share price is rising is anyone's guess. Prices can rise in overvalued stocks and fall in undervalued ones. All you can do is buy undervalued assets and avoid overvalued ones. I will avoid buying NAB unless it trades under $25. If it does not then that is life. There are plenty of other undervalued stocks out there for me anyhow.
