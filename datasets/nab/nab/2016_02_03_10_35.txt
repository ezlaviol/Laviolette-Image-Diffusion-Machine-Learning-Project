2016-02-03T10:35:00+11:00 : I don't believe that's true.  As posted above, if you have less than 2000 NAB shares you have the option to sell your CYB shares but you're not required to.  If you do choose to sell some, you must sell them all.

Election to sell your shares must be done by 5pm today.  You can make/change your election at http://www.clydesdaledemerger.com.au/offer/
