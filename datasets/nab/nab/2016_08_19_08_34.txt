2016-08-19T08:34:00+10:00 : MELBOURNE, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service has  downwardly revised its outlook on Australia's banks to negative,  warning that their profit growth could slow due to weak wage  growth, low interest rates, strong lending competition and  rising household debt.  	The ratings agency also warned of rising problem loans in  the resources sector, resource-related industries and households  in mining-dependent states in its decision to revise the outlook  from stable.  	"The outlook change reflects Moody's expectation of a more  challenging operating environment for banks in Australia for the  remainder of 2016 and beyond, and which could lead to a  deterioration in their profit growth and asset quality as well  as an increase in their sensitivity to external shocks," Frank  Mirenzi, a vice president and senior analyst at Moody's, said in  a statement.  	Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  (ANZ)   acknowledged the change in outlook on Friday, but noted that  Moody's had reaffirmed ANZ's 'Aa2' rating.
