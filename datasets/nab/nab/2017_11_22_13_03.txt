CBA, WBC and the others have already come under fire for bank swap bill rate or something else and Thorburn did say he was taking costs out. Do not think he will be able to do tha now with the banking Royal Commission. That might cost more in penalties, fines and sancti9ns than the cutting costs is worth IMHO but pls DYOR.

I would say of all of them NAB might be the most likely to potentially cut the divi, on the grounds of investment in digital technology or some justification.
