2002-04-23T11:45:00+10:00 : There must be lots of NAB shareholders in Scotland as the paper has another long article today regarding the lack of disclosure.The Bank says it complies with the regulations."Banks' dealings must be transparent SIMON BAIN Small business leaders have called for full transparency in the accounts of the country's banks in relation to any financial dealings with non-executive directors. The Herald reported yesterday on questions raised by the degree of disclosure in the accounts of the Clydesdale Bank and its parent National Australia Bank (NAB), in the light of evidence at Companies House of loans made to companies connected with Sir Fraser Morrison, the bank's deputy chairman. Our inquiries traced £15m of loans from the bank, as well as a £13m contract for the high-profile Millennium Link canal project, to ventures involving the Morrison Group, none of which have been specified in annual accounts. The revelations came hard on the heels of the row over the speech by Frank Cicutto, NAB chief executive, criticising Scotland's record on wealth creation.John Downie, Scottish parliamentary officer of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "It doesn't put the bank in a good light. Propriety is now an extremely important issue, and in terms of their openness and transparency with small business customers these issues should have been very clearly aired." Gerry Dowds, Scottish director of the Forum of Private Business, (FPB) said: "The bank would be very wise to be whiter than white about the terms and purposes of loans to non-executives." Dowds added that the Clydesdale finished bottom in the most recent FPB banking survey.The Accounting Standards Board stated that transactions of any sort involving non-executive directors were likely to be covered by its related parties rules on specific disclosure, while aggregate loans of all kinds to directors and any businesses connected to them were disclosable under the Companies Act, 1985. The Clydesdale has said that its accounts comply with regulat-ory requirements in the UK and Australia.- April 23rd"
