Where is the evidence of these breaches? Do you have the link to the “documentation” that supports your ordering of the banks? I saw the digital banking platforms to be connected to the AML breaches just look at IFTIs (CBA) and Litepay (WBC). NAB has issues with fees within its systems.If you have evidence, please present the links. Thanks.
