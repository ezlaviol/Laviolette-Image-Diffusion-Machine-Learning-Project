2017-05-15T13:47:00+10:00 : Morrison cites the bank levy in the UK as justification for introducing it here in the 2017 budget papers.

This is what happened in the UK after it's introduction in 2010.

The bank levy is a charge on UK banks’ global balance sheets, and on the UK activities of foreign banks. George Osborne introduced the tax in 2010 at 0.05pc of a bank’s liabilities, and has increased it nine times since. The biggest hike came in the March 2015 budget, when the levy was raised to 0.21pc from 0.16pc.

Other countries in Europe have a levy designed to pay into a resolution fund. But the BBA argues they are less of a burden, as the rate is typically set at below 0.05pc, and the levy will only continue until the fund is paid for. By contrast, “ours (UK) is never-ending”, said Mr Browne.

Not only the above, but....

In the UK Summer Budget 2015, the government announced it would cut a punitive bank tax and reduce its impact on global lenders in an attempt to keep HSBC and Standard Chartered from moving abroad, but damped cheer with a new surcharge on British banks.
Chancellor George Osborne said in his Budget that the £3bn bank levy would be gradually reduced over the next six years and stop applying to worldwide assets from 2021.
The levy changes are expected to appease HSBC and StanChart in particular, after both threatened to move their headquarters abroad partly as a result of the bank tax. But, at the same time as alleviating the levy, the government will introduce a new 8 per cent surcharge on bank profits from the start of next year to cushion any fall in revenue to the exchequer.
