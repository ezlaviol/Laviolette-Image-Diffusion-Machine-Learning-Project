Happy to take the chance as the dividends mitigate the risk even if they are reduced like during the GFC, from what I can tell, this is not the GFC and people are spending up big on retail so they can play roll the roll in the highly unlikely event that they are stuck inside given that less than .0000001% of the worlds population is affected. A business bank should be happy with all this panic retail sales.  If there is a recession as well, then this is probably because of the government policies over the last few years, not really the result of Chinese bat eating.  Anyway a big thank you for selling me your cheap nab shares sheeples...... Appreciated   Back to buying toilet paper you go..... You can never have enough.... ever....  Actually maybe retail should just convert thermal till rolls into printing onto loo paper, this would have people buying all day! ... Patent pending.....
