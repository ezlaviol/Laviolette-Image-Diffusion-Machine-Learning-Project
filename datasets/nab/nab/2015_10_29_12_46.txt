I am aware of the many corparate debacles from 2000 on, but not so much befor then. But the savagery dealt to individual customers is appaling. I remember CEO Ahmed Fahour seemed to have a very short tenure as the top-dog, maybe the hypocricy became too much for him, or the board deemed him not to have a good enough grasp on corparte speak (Orwellian) of exonerating the bank on all fronts. And these bankster wonder why the term "bastard banks" is so common in this country. For my shame, I am a share-holder in this company. I might have to remedy that, after dividend date.
