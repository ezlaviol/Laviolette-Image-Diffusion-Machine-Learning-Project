2018-12-19T12:52:00+11:00 : Never in my 66 years have I seen such ARROGANCE as the Directors of NAB.
They all deserve to be DISMISSED at best or should show some dignity and RESIGN after awarding themselves a BONUS in what turned out to be one of the WORST YEARS in every regard .
Mr Henry is an EMBARRASSEMENT to Australian Commerce.
His conduct at the Royal Commission was nothing but RAW ARROGANCE.
Today he is asking for another GO.
Properly speaking he should be DISMISSED and made to pay back all BONUSES he paid himself.
I truly hope he is CHARGED ARRESTED and made to serve a Jail SENTENCE as a clear message to all the Cheaters who greedily help themselves to '
all sorts of undeserved monies while acting in the lowest possible Moral manner.
The Greed and ravenousness of Australian Directors at large is OFFENSIVE.
We as shareholders have had enough.
You are paid MONSTROUSLY way too much money for your low level of skills, and your complete lack of all morals as continuously gets demonstrated
to all of us WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY.
