2023-08-16T07:01:00+10:00 : never terribly comfortable come aug/sep/octresults were great for nab. The market overnight continues its shaky August wobbles.. $28.70 not looking to bad actually and i came close to a sell.i always keep in mind how vulnerable the human psychology can be with stocks i.e. when things are looking up the sky's the limit, the pheromones kick in and we hold to long. The opposite when prices are tanking and we either sell to early or are reluctant to buy because there appears no bottom (the fear kicks in)NAB's $29 resistance also marries with ANZ's ceiling and WBC's inability to ish higher than mid $22’sso is this a banking ceiling right now? and a good time to take profits and wait a retrace???let's see what the remaining month brings however i am of the view that high $28’s for NAB may be a better sell trigger for me than into the $29’s
