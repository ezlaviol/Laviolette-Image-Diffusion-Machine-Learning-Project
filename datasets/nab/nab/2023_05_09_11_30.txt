2023-05-09T11:30:00+10:00 : May 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell on Tuesday, dragged by financials after the country's largest lender warned of a near-term impact on profit margins due to high competition in the mortgage market. 	The S&P/ASX 200 index  (xjo)  slipped 0.5% to 7,248.2 points by 0033 GMT. The benchmark added 0.8% on Monday. 	Financials  .AXFJ  retreated as much as 1.1%, losing for the first time in three sessions. 	Commonwealth Bank of Australia  (CBA)  dropped 1% after the lender hinted at potentially weak credit growth and weaker margins in the coming months.  	Westpac Banking Corp  (WBC) , ANZ Group Holdings  (ANZ)  and National Australia Bank  (NAB)  slid 0.5%-2%.  	Market participants will eye United States' consumer prices data for April due on Wednesday — where core inflation is expected to have slowed moderately — for further clues on the Federal Reserve's rate decision.	 	Energy stocks  .AXEJ  declined 1.1% after oil prices dipped overnight over uncertainty around Fed's future actions.

Newcrest Mining  (NCM)  and Ramelius Resources  (RMS)  traded down 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively.  	Separately, Australia is set to deliver its first budget surplus in 15 years giving the country room to dole out cost-of-living relief amid an inflation squeeze on households. 	Across the Tasman sea, New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index  (nz50)  slipped 0.7% to 11,917.56 points. 	Tourism Holdings Ltd  (THL)  and Meridian Energy Ltd  (MEL)  were the top losers on the bourse.
