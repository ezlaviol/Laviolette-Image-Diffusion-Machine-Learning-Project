They can put it in the bank as a safe return. Id say one of if not the safest return you can have as I believe up to $100,000 in a recognized banking institution is backed by the government. ie if they cant pay it back the government will.Also all these Z1P and APT. Where do you think they get the money to loan to people to pay for items right now? They dont have the large cash required to avoid banks. They would go to a bank for a loan to help fuel the large amount of money they payout to people.The big issue I see is, all these loans. What risk factors are they? I hope the banks are doing the due diligence on how for example APT assess credibility of a client for finance. Or else we will end up with a BNPL bubble with people that simply walk away from the assets or dont pay back the debts.As others have said though, banks are banks. Without them we have no economy and the government wouldnt let them fail (too big to fail theory) or else there would be anarchy.
