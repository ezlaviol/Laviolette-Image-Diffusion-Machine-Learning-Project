2021-03-18T07:32:00+11:00 : Uneducated comment...CBA dividend for the last two payments reduced to around 60% of the previous years($4.30 to $2.50) result while on the other hand NAB reduced to 30% of the previous years result ($1.98 to 60c). To my mind NAB has a lot of catching up to do and therefore I expect the dividend will need to increase significantly and I will be disappointed if it is below 70c. IMO
