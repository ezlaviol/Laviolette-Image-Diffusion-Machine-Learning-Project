2019-05-13T16:22:00+10:00 : canâ€™t read too much into this selling, market forces have a lot of factors driving prices up and down. Those buying now will get the benefits of a good tax free dividend, and yes the SP will fall tomorrow but long term the price regathers back to where the value is. At $25 there is reasonable value, so take the dividend and enjoy. Franking credit refunds may still apply beyond 2019, we have to wait on this.
