Given we are so far through the earnings period then that adds weight to yours and a somewhat limited dividend downside (it will be a balancing act for the board).  I picked up on pete444's dividend thoughts, and how a drop in dividends often accompanies an earlier drop in share price. That scenario often plays out as well, and needs factoring into a buy/sell decision and timing. Amongst all the "this is so cheap cos it was $30" talk my head says that to expect a 15% grossed up divy may be unrealistic. It is a guessing game though.  Make the point it traded Friday at 1997 levels and under 2008. They are emotional levels and charting levels. We will see if they are financial value levels soon.  (I actually hope they are)Good luck to all of us.
