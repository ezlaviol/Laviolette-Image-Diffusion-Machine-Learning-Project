2019-11-08T08:40:00+11:00 : AFR is reporting that the interim Chief Executive Phil Chronican has blamed the poor result on the regulatory mess, I find that ironic, it would not happen in the United States, someone blaming their business governance, risk and compliance failings on the regulator would find themselves in a regulatory mess to oblivion. This may not end well.like a child saying I canâ€™t be good. I am just bad. Michael Jackson like and look what he did and what happened to him.Change my sentiment back to sell from hold, NAB Aiz calling out to be penalised IMHO looking T what the AFR has reported.As they say in sport, if you abuse the officials, you get penalized. Australian banking might find itself treated similar to the sporting folk.
