2018-10-18T09:21:00+11:00 : About 60% of the Aussie Banks business is home lending.....they are really not ‘real ‘ banks and are more like Building Societies. This good and bad. In my view the chances of any of the big four having SPs  which recover to all time highs is close to zero...in the next 5 or 10 years.Profitabily is still ok and Dividends may drop a little...say 10 or 15% but barring disasters that should be the extent of the ‘damage’.So, NAB may fall more...it depends on the US Market, however if you are buying for long term Dividends ( not capital growth) you could do a lot worse.

I am purely chasing nab for income/dividends- With all the talk on here about the divvy being cut would it be prudent to wait for Nov 1 before committing! Some sound advice please.
