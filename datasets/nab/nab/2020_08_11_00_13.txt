2020-08-11T00:13:00+10:00 : this market is GREAT for short term traders like myself. nab is the perfect short term trading stock in this environment. it's a nice safe blue chip you can throw all your money at and not have to worry about waking up in the morning to see them in a trading halt before going into administration. this new bullish wave is based on covid getting better in vic and dividends being paid or financial results not as bad as expected. the next bearish wave will be unemployment and incorporating covid into a working society as the majority of the population twiddling their thumbs sitting at home so old people don't die is unsustainable and financially irresponsible.
