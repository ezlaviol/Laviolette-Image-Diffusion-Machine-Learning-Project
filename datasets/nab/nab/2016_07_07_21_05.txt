but a happy medium one may perhaps look at a NABY88.

if your convinced the sp will not fall too much and your happy with slightly more risk perhaps a NABXQ8, which will obviously provide a better premium.

for the risk averse that have a more bearish outlook on the stock perhaps a NABN99

all depends on personal preference really and how bad I guess someone really wants in on the stock

also depends on the open interest on those codes

my personal preference would lean towards the NABY88
