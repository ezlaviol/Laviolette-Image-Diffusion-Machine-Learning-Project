2019-10-17T08:54:00+11:00 : Thanks J,I've got to say, I rarely take the Fed Reserve Bank of St Louis into consideration when I am investing.On your 3 points, you are probably aware that points 1) & 2) are a direct result of point 3).  Not sure how they can win this one; they had their guts kicked in for lending too much, too easily, so now they get their guts kicked in for not lending enough too readily.I have stated previously that I think the collective Banks reluctance to lend is a 'big finger' to the Aust Govt, who are already trying to encourage the Banks to go back closer to their old ways and lend money more readily again.  I know a lot of current lenders who work for the major Banks and they are just as frustrated with the restrictions that their employers have applied to new lending as their customers are.  Somewhere they might find the happy medium.On the up side, the Banks are still making lots of money on the loans that they are sitting on, so as shareholders (which I note you are not, which makes me wonder why you are on this thread) we shouldn't be too concerned.Final commentFlip
