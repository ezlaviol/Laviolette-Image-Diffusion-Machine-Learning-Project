2021-09-28T08:25:00+10:00 : Looks like Docklands is Gone.... Once Nab moved back into the "city"  Dumped a 1-bed apartment to a FHB recently in the docklands.. 12 years underwater.  because of less stock on market due to lockdown. Served a few Nab people for the past 12 years. End of NightMare.  Break-even after all these years of rental and sold the apartment at a loss to cost price. Only Buy with land type in Melbourne. my 6 others with land are valued like crazy, except this super wrong stupidest apartment with a body corp of $3800+~$5100/year 1-Bed. NAB is still the best bank to trade and do whatever you like. even offline in property rentals, she helps you. Anyway. Lucky NAB didn't "own" the Building so can move around.
