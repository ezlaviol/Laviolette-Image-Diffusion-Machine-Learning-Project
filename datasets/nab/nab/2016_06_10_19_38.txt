Fingers crossed for a break through 26. Need another good (bad) day to get the ball rolling but I like to start at 26. Gently does it. To hard a drop just makes a big bounce and I'd prefer to spend at least 3 months getting in.

Started my ANZ, BOQ and BEN today as well. Ben getting attacked by shorters very nicely. Nice to follow it down and wait for the turnaround.
