2020-10-04T23:42:00+11:00 : maybe read what his policies have achieved and what republicans stand for... idiotic post of the night I’ve read. The New Democrats are the  furthest left they’ve ever been with a lot of anti business and high tax policies set to come into play. Think Bill Shorten but worse for Biden democrats... remember how much the Asx rebounded on him losing the election?. The Australian share market crashed on fears of trumps illness hurting a second term Trump, aka republicans who are pro business. Trump achieved the lowest unemployment in the USA since WW2, quite a feat. His tax policies are terrific to encourage business which is why you’ve seen a return of manufacturing and huge increases in employment pre covid.You shouldn’t be investing if you don’t understand basics such as republicans (especially trump era) - pro markets. Current democrat - anti business and bad for share markets. The New Democrat tax rises should easily clip the S&P500 10% just due to lost earnings on tax. Add in an anti business and high red tape again, you’ve got a bear market (excluding covid).Some poorly written tweets don’t reflect what greatness his party has done for global commerce. Try reading something other than being told orange man bad from the ABC or CNN. Staggers me how little a lot of people know other than being told by bias news how to feel.
