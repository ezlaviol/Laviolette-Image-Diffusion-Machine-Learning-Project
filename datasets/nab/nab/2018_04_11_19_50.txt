There is one thing that is missing from todays' society... and cant be taught at School and University.

Not many have a degree in  C.S.  Common Sense !!!!  Would you divulge your personal details to a complete stranger you just met. Then  what's the difference with FacePlant .. oops sorry FaceBook ?

Also The 'Instant Gratification Syndrome'   I gotta know now.

Adding to this 'we need things done yesterday'  another Syndrome.

How many of us read in detail, let alone understand them, the Terms and Conditions -- Product Disclosure Statements -- Guarantees-- Applications for Loans etc...   most compiled by Legal Eagles.  ... as Sienfield said in one of his -voice overs  the Movie  'The Bees ' I quote - 'Mossies with Briefcases'.

This is all IMHO.   and just a little humour I hope .

Keep safe all
