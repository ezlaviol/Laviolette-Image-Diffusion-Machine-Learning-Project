2019-01-02T14:55:00+11:00 : Is there anyone on here who works for NAB who can go int their archives to confirm that NAB issued an NCD for 4 years to HBA  at 26% PA during Mr Whitlams years. Another was for 24% pa . Its old history I checked with my Director at the time with the Late Tom Luxton who passed away in May 2016. $2 million each if i recall correctly. I bought them for our company.

History of interest rates during ALP years is always interesting... Keating 19%

What will Bill Shorten bring?

I was waiting for $26 but $23.60 and falling under ALP policy fears is something else eh.
