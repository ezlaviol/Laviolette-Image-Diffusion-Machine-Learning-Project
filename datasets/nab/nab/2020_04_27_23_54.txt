2020-04-27T23:54:00+10:00 : Im just trying to tie the temporary entrants in with the housing price decline we are heading for and its possible future impact on banks with more bad loans they have not accounted for yet. Investors with loans may be able to defer payments whilst offering discounts to renters or not evicting them over 3 to 6 months. Come the end of 6 months many of these tenants may have left the country or have no money to pay rent or airfare back home. What if you get no tenants for a while or loose your job.350,000 less resident in this country by years end and 500,000 relient on charity will have to hit housing and a lot of businesses imo. Throw in next to no immigration for a year or two makes housing a lousy investment.
