What do you mean by - "NAB as a newbie"?? and why would a Royal Commission focus on NAB ahead of the others?
Not sure what newspapers you're reading but NAB has not missed out on being involved in the Bank Bill Swap Rate drama and has settled the case!! They've also had other "issues" and have taken  their turn in the firing line just like the others.................
A Royal Commission will be a cost to all the Banks, however don't understand why it will stop any Bank moving forward with their business plans whatever they might be (or how right they are)

You may well end up being right about the Divi, but your reasons why NAB will be significantly more impacted if a Royal Commission happens don't add up.................
