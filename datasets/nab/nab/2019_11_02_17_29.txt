In fact it could be said the High Tide was 2007  . Long term banks holders have nothing but Yield in that time   . Buy and Hold with banks is dead and has been for a long time  .  ANZ div cut with a FF cut is the start of the decline  .   Sure you  can trade banks and i do  but a trader should have sold them inside the last month for the recent high will not be beaten for a long time
