2016-06-23T20:18:00+10:00 : Euro markets having a cracker so far. US markets look to open very strong unless the first set of results that start to trickle through look shaky. First results coming through @9am tomorrow morning for us from what I have read. That should set the scene for a fun opening. remain odds have strengthened to 81% vs 19% leave. If you had to bet right now based on what's available you would be crazy to support a leave vote but even with what looks to be the odds stacked in favour of remain I'm still happy to wait and see. Might be some cheap gold stocks floating around tomorrow 

Clocks tickin dude.
