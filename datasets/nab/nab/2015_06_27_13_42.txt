 rate 3.39% on par of 100 dollars
actual rate[at yesterdays price of 71.47]  4.75%

these are not Basel compliant, but still cheap money for the bank[1.25% above 30 day bank bill rate].
plus, they can suspend interest payments, at no cost, if they suspend dividends on the ords .

hard to see it ever being worthwhile buying them back at par, but possibly an offer between 80 and 90 dollars , depending on interest rates.

see benhb and what happened to them as a [I hope] guide.

keep in mind their inherent, though modest, leverage to movements in interest rates.
