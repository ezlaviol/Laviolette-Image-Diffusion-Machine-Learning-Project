2020-03-26T11:56:00+11:00 : Government led isolation measures will mean flu season will actually be less severe this year. Streets are emptying, people are not crowding and everyone is panicking and addressing their health and trying to, sensibly, stay indoors (other than some idiots). So ironically, we could have best winter in terms of seasonal flu outbreaks as a result. Plus I see people rushing into get flu jabs in their local chemist/doctors etc myself included. So I think COVID19 will still be the main game. I see sentiment changing in 3 scenarios. 1) Someone in the world announces major vaccine breakthrough 2) doctors find an effective treatment that turns COVID19 into far milder illness 3) some smart inventor makes a cheap easy to manufacture testing kit which can quickly decides who has and who doesn't have COVID, and the people who don't have it can just start to go to work and be part of the mass that rekindle the dying economy. 2 minute spot check COVID19 testing kit readily available at ChemistWarehouse... Imagine that.
