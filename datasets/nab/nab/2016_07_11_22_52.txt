By the amount of volatility around, I would guess for quite a while. Just look at some of the posts on this thread. Some say the banking world is coming to an end (see I listen @Lurkin) others think nab will be over 30 by the end of the year. It doesn't matter who is correct as long as it goes up and down on the way there. 

Speaking of @Lurkin, Nab have just lowered some their fixed home loan rates for up to four years to below 4% . Looks like housing prices are here to stay then . (are you listening? ).
