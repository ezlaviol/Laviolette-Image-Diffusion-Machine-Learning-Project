2017-12-11T17:57:00+11:00 : Usually see the volume, on the charts, but not as clearly as HotCopper's NAB apparent volume tally every 15 minutes, which suggests volume gradually rose as today progressed.

There is a volume drop showing for 1600, wonder IF included were the Closing Price Auction trades around 1610 ?   

Showing low opening volume today  wonder if  opening Price Auction trades volume was lower, or not included ?
