2018-11-23T16:56:00+11:00 : Not complaining compared to where we were last week but it’s clear that NAB continue to underperform even in the recovery compared to the other big 3 which is very frustrating.

Anyhow fingers crossed this is the recover in banks we’re hoping for. Holding since $24.87 and I’m hoping to exit around $26 all things going well.
