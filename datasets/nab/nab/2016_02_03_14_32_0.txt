I admit to not reading the 500-page prospectus, but is anyone able to clarify the significance, implications or "fairness" of this greenshoe arrangement by underwriting banks? Is this intended to stabilise price action and benefit market participants, or is it more likely a mechanism for underwriting investment banks to exploit volatility?

Thanks in advance.
