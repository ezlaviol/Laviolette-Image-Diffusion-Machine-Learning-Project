The bad news was already factored in to the banks over a protracted period of time with the weight of the R/C bearing down...That created the buying opportunity for the astute patient investors that saw value...No government would ever dare risk the economy before an election or ever, especially a Liberal government so while the post R/C talk was tough the proposed action is very predictably weak and there you have it....these buying opportunities don’t come along very often and the market doesn’t hold a sign up saying BUY. In fact often the exact opposite happens to create selling momentum by brokers sometimes seducing retail investors sitting on big losses to sell right into their hands, the hands of the very people creating the doubt in the market. Banks today I believe all gapped up so the price action will be very interesting in the coming weeks....
