Ralom, I agree with much of what you wrote about customer behaviour in taking out loans, shareholder expectations of profit and bank personnel responding accordingly. Here I have to advise to conflict as a long time NAB shareholder and customer (both private and business). As a customer I have nothing but praise for our agribusiness managers and counter staff over the years. And yes there have been moments of frustration but nothing compared with dealing with any and all levels of government...As a shareholder, my disappointment is extant.Seems to me we could have RCs into pretty much every industry and have similar findings of greed, malfeasance etc. This goes to very heart of who we are and our own personal conduct.And on the subject of personal conduct, I do hold a particularly strong view on the behaviour of AndrewThorburn in relation to the reported acceptance of substantial gifts from a supplier to the NAB. The performance of a CEO sets the standard for the rest of the organisation so is it any wonder that poor conduct can flow through a business when such example is displayed by the CEO.Here is the challenge for NAB: can Thorburn be the change agent and leader needed to instill integrity across the company?Which brings us to the Board and its tolerance of Thorburn's conduct...Anyone have a view?
