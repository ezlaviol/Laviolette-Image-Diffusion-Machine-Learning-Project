2018-03-01T09:38:00+11:00 : Hi Huninni,
I tend to look at Dow Futures around 3.30pm to guesstimate whether Dow is likely to go up or down overnight. I monitored this over a 3 month period, only taking into account significant figures over 25 points up or down. Over this period I found the futures accurate 2/3 of the time. If futures were 0-25 I tended to ignore .
Yesterday at 3.30pm futures were 30-40 points down so I closed NWS for a good profit leaving me with no stocks in my trading account.
I believe that NAB, NWS- because of candlestick signals will continue up though less likely today. Depending on the action and the Dow futures later today I will be keen to buy back in.
You are right, DMP does look shaky so I am reluctant to jump in until I feel more confident the selling is done. Then they will be a screaming buy.
WPL is a no brainer to buy though will sit today watching the action. Oil was down overnight too.
I haven't been watching HVN.
NCM is nearing support so is becoming interesting. Again, on a day like today, will watch most of the day.
Not sure about RHC or QBE.
TLS is an eternal disappointment though you will probably make some profits there.
So overall, I remain very keen on NAB, NWS and WPL and might buy back in today though am likely to wait until around 3.30pm in case Dow futures indicate another down night.
I'm enjoying our thread huninni! It  is much better than the extreme ramping and back biting rubbish that people are posting!!
Keen to continue our discussions for our mutual benefit.
