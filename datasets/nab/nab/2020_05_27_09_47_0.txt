2020-05-27T09:47:00+10:00 : My guess at how it may be calculated (and this may be very wrong)

21% of shareholdings applied = 603m shares
25% of eligible shareholders applied = 154k
Average shareholding of those that applied = 3915 shares

If I have 1000 shares

1000/3915 = 0.26

If I applied for the full 2120 shares/$30k then I get 26% of what I applied for = 551 shares/$7.8k

What this doesn't take into account is a proportion of shareholders that have very high holdings that far exceed 3915 shares that are skewing this average up, but are limited to a maximum allocation of $30k worth of shares.

Pull this apart as there are holes that I have neglected to fill.
