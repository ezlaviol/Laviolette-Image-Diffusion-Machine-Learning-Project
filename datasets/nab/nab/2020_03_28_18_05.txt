SO there's a real disconnect for me, people say they like supporting small business, but 30% of their meal order through UberEats will go to an offshore giant, while a local business gets less money and fewer locals (often youth and unskilled workers) get fewer opportunities cause there is less money available for the local operation."But we need to support Small business" is the catchcry.Put on some pants and shoes and visit the store then. OR catch a taxi and be prepared to pay a couple of dollars more for the same service.Link to NAB: NAB is a business lender for many of these local operations. I hope people can see the link between the availability of capital and local jobs for business owners and young people.
