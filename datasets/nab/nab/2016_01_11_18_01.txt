2016-01-11T18:01:00+11:00 : Very disappointing share price really... Not that I'm concerned about short term movements but NAB is really in the toilet!
10% fully franked return is great, but only if the share price can drift upwards at least a little over the longer term and she only knows one direction in recent times.
