2019-05-03T09:19:00+10:00 : I will walk straight around any changes that are made, but less fortunate, both older and younger people will be negatively impacted.  Younger people are doublly disadvantaged because they will never have the opportunity that older people have had to build wealth. The changes are fundamentally unfair as people on the same income will pay a different amount of net tax. It is stupid and devisive policy being largely supported by people who don't understand it.
