2023-05-10T09:40:00+10:00 : Div worth around $1-18. May see largest drop in early trade (drops or rises often overshoot) so might be able to pick up some at good discount (either side of $26) however assuming a fairly flat market, selling (triggering cgt) to repurchase ex dividend a bit hit and miss.(Traders no doubt view it differently in regard to Franking and CGT which would make it more worthwhile.) Of course any change in sentiment can impact either way................
