I bought for the dividends too (I seldom sell my holdings), but seeing my ctr deep red whenever I sign-in to my broker's session doesn't help with the spirit of the day,.... furthermore, how would you know if NAB would not fall further from here on ??I averaged down once last year, but when it keeps dropping, I stopped averaging down, and preferred to hold my funds inside my broker's account which gives me a yield of 2.15% instead. Better to earn a 2.15% yield than to suffer capital loss after buying-in,... A double wham to 'falling further' would be a fall in the dps payout,........ which translates into further sp drops,....
