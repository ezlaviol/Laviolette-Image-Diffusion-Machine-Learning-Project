2017-02-08T16:12:00+11:00 : These securities are cheap money for the bank and they don't have to redeem them - why would they pay 100 when they are trading around 73? But in looking at the recent price increase,  volumes and general surplus of buyers, I am wondering if there could be an on-market buyback happening? I think other issuers have done it previously with these perpetual beasts but is that something the bank would do, since it's a very large chunk of money?
