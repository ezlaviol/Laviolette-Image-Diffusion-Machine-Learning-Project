2019-10-16T22:46:00+11:00 : You are as you say confused as you have been hoodwinked by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Government and whoever else reckons the Australian economy has not had a recession since 1991. Whomever goes along with that, needs to examine the recent critiques and economic analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has now debunked RBA claims of no recession as a totally false statistic.The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis has called out that false statistic as fake. Australia has had 4 recessions in 28 years, not zero, the GDP per capita has gone negative in two consecutive quarters four time in the last 28 years.The way that RBA fakes it and falsifies the statistics is by counting in the 190,000 immigrants per year who have a 31% unemployment rate for newly arrived migrants. I mean only 69% have any possible positive contribution, the others are economic burdens, congestion burdens and should not be counted as positive.That is why overall GDP is positive because of the immigrants, 31% of which are unemployed in their first year.it is not good for NAB. Not good for housing, not good for rates, four times bigger downgrade by the IMF just yesterday.To get out of confusion, look at the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis criticism of this Philip Lowe, the RBA and falsehoods keeping back the Australian economy and the NAB SP.
