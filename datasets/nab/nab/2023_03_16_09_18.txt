2023-03-16T09:18:00+11:00 : Unfortunately, it is pointless replying to you because you will just deflect onto the next headline that comes on your ticker machine!Your first sentence confirms your total lack of understanding of banking regulations.You also always conflate issues and can't seem to separate the macro environment from the headline grabbers. Australian banks are heavily regulated but of course it does not mean they are immune from any global economic situation and certainly will have an increase in bad exposures locally and through worldwide syndicated funding during any downturn - That's their business!APRA has based Australian bank regulation on the Basel reforms to ensure they are strongly capitalised and able to weather economic storms at least as well as any bank around the world.. Regardless of your rhetoric our banks have very strong balance sheets and to suggest we have less regulations than other countries is absolute nonsense.This does not mean we will be immune to a worldwide capital squeeze and suffer more bad debts if our economy falters but that is no different to anyone else. I suggest your read an unbiased factual account of events during the GFC. Understanding what actually happened during the GFC may help you understand how strong our banks are and capital regulations have been significantly strengthened since then.As I said, it would make much more sense for you to be squawking about the lack of control over the enormous number of US banks, our troubles always start with poor US controls.Anyway, I am sure you will deflect onto some nonsense about AML penalties or banking casinos or whatever new headline you get excited about.Good luck to you.......
