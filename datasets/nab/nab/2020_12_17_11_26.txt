Wow, I am unsure what the definition of "bunch" is but if you're suggesting this tactic has artificially inflated demand and price it must have been thousands and thousands
Weird that you know so many people who met the criteria to withdraw from super and then plonk it straight into shares. 
(If, of course a "bunch" is say 5 or 6 then that sort of volume would have no bearing at all on any trading activity in the big 4)
