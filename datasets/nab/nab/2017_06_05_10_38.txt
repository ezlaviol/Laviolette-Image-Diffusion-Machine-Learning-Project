2017-06-05T10:38:00+10:00 : The sector taking a decent hit again this morning, NAB moving generally in line with that.

With SP in the mid $29s NAB yields around 6.7% from a fully franked $1.98 dividend; add the FF credit and it looks attractive. 

Some analysts have forecast a reduction in the divvy to $1.94 FF so factor that into calculations but the impact of 4c is negligible.

I'm of the opinion that the banking sector has potentially a bit further to fall, so I personally will resist the temptation to increase my NAB holdings now. I was previously targeting $27 as a buy during this price cycle but upon reviewing the chart I'm now thinking $28 could be a more probable price.

If Trump is impeached or steps on his you-know-what hard enough it's easy to see a mini crash/correction in financials and that could throw up a much lower price.
