Is Australia part of the EU? Or the USA? Countries outside the EU do just fine once they adjust. This will be no different. What's the clue? Gold. From 1260ish - 1362 and sold off to 1324 if I look. A collapse would have gold @1500 imo. Interesting times indeed. It's a good time to alive to see such events that change the world. I have a friend in the UK selling a 2b/r flat. The brexit is not going to do the conversion of pounds to AU any favours. She was hoping to sell up and buy a house here and be debt free. Now she might have to borrow a little more. No problem I say, we have great banks here  A little beaten today for sure. Another down day on Monday? I hope so. I'd like to start with a very low average this pump around. 24ish would be nice. Or 20 . Optimism ! Keep that strap fastened tight, the ride is wobbly. Not sure what I'd be doing as a holder right now. Probably telling myself whatever decision I make will be the wrong one at the wrong time.
