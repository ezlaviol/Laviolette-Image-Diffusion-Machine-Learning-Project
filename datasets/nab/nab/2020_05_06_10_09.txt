Little doubt that there is some concern in the market about the final economic impact of covid-19 and whether the banks have underestimated and will need more capital, many seem to think so. 
ANZ ann seemed very unsure and it certainly appears they are playing a wait and see with a raising down the track a distinct possibility. WBC similar although they have only recently raised so either way all 3 may need more capital and NAB may deem it wise to grab the opportunity to get a bit more buffer from retail now 
(Certainly shouldn't try to apply for an amount based on an expected outcome )
