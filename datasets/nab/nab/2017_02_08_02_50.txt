2017-02-08T02:50:00+11:00 : Tq SW,... yes, I am, in fact,... doing exactly this. I have used $1.95 as a possible dpu later, which would still give me 6.4%. Don't forget that there is still the imputed credits from the 100% franking. With $1.95 gross, the imputed credit will give me another 83.60 Cts, but of course, this will only be refunded to me if my taxation bracket allows. Otherwise, this imputed credit will help me to offset my taxes to be paid.

I'm quite sure, whatever the case, this bank will continue with its 100% franking arrangement.
