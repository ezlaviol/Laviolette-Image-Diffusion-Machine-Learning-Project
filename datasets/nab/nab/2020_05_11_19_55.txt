2020-05-11T19:55:00+10:00 : when doing guesstimates on how much this spp will be oversubscribed by, we need to consider that there are now about 6 million australians on jobkeeper allowance, so that's about half of Australia's workforce potentially lacking money to put into a share purchase plan.So this event seems quite different to the 2009 series of bank spp's when there was no Australian economic recession....and there was a shareholder participation rate of about 40% in ANZ and about 15% in CBA spp's back then.I think those that participate in this spp, will be pleased with the final allocation they recieve and I'd be surprised if there was more than $2billion raised in this spp...& I'll be even more surprised if the bank doesn't accept more than $500mill.
