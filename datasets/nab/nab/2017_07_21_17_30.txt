The S&P/ASX 200 index (xjo) fell 38.65 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,722.8 at the close of trade. The benchmark rose 0.5 percent on Thursday. For the week, the index was down 0.7 percent.  	A gauge of financial stocks .AXFJ posted its second weekly gain but ended about 0.8 percent lower while the 'Big Four' banks - Commonwealth Bank (CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC), ANZ Banking Group (ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) - closed between 0.5 to 1.1 percent lower. 	Financials had rallied as the banks, especially the Big Four, declared they were comfortable with new capital rules unveiled by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) on Wednesday.  	Global miner BHP Billiton (BHP) was the biggest laggard on the benchmark ending about 1.9 percent lower. Activist shareholder Elliott Management voiced concerns over BHP's proposal to enter the over-supplied fertiliser market.
