2019-05-13T17:23:00+10:00 : not clear on your formula, but otherwise if you get an 83 cent fully franked dividend in your super fund that has its earnings taxed, you get no refund of the franking credit but the actual dividend of 83 cents is TAX FREE because the tax is already paid by the company. The refund of the franking credit only applies if you  pay no tax or in pension mode in SMSF.therefore, in your case, the net return is 6.52% p.a. ie 3.26% return on this current dividend payout. Not bad compared with cash returns of 1-2% taxed in a cash management account!
