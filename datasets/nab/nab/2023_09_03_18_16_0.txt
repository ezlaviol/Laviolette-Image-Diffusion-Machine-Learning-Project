Ross McEwen did not get RBS/ NatWest back on track, in fact they are still making mistakes like the Nigel Farage politically exposed person fiasco which started under McEwen. If NAB had an incident like that, similar to the Qantas Con Air fiasco, it would be extremely damaging.And NAB needs more staff, run on a smell of an oily rag is only good while it lasts until scandal hits. Like a money laundering scandal?NAB simply does not have enough people and is understaffed compared to the responsibilities of a bank holding license IMHO.
