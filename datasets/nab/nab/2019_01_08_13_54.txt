Now not only has it back flipped from the mining boom downturn but the labor government propose to cut or at best grandfather negative gearing which would undeniably lower house prices further. Perhaps I could raise a class action lawsuit against the government for loss of capital growth as a direct result to policy making (hahahaha they will kill you in court). This is why considering policy is pretty damn important. They change the rules like they change light globes these days and that is why its MORE important now than ever not to be ignorant to it.I have clients that due to changes in policies have been almost forced to sell property due to tax implications and changes in policies. They can cost you thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars if you put your head in the sand. Back to the franking credit issue. Labor are just creating a complex messy stew and it stinks. As a tax agent its hard enough every other change we deal with regarding individuals let alone massive changes to company tax rates, company franking accounts, depreciation and the list goes on. Now they want to make complex areas even more messy and create more unnecessary work. Oh hang on this client is a grandfathered investment property owner there for he is eligible to negative gear.... What a mess, if "Short on Ideas" gets in power put your seatbelt on we will be going off a cliff!
