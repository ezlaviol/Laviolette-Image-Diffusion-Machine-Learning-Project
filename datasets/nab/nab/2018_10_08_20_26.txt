2018-10-08T20:26:00+11:00 : I also topped up today at $26.85 which brings my average price to $27.44. These guys are a long term hold for me so not intending to dispose ex dividend or anything like that. At some point the banks will come back into favour and when that does happen I can see them running back up quite quickly. That won't happen for quite a while but I will keep taking the dividend in the meantime and building up my holdings when we get dips like today.
