2018-02-09T12:47:00+11:00 : Looking at the big fours sp movement in the last month and then 3 months, NAB has had the least drop. In order ( 3 months ) lowest to highest drop NAB, CBA, ANZ , WBC.
1 Month (% loss) lowest to highest  NAB, ANZ, WBC, CBA.

It re-affirms my opinion that NAB is presently positioned the best of the Banks and when the ASX gets back to 6200 ,or so, NAB will get to around $32 ish minimum (only my opinion)

Re- dividends -  CBA just gone up 1c (6monthly), market apparently was disappointed as expecting $2.06 interim.
Why wld you expect NAB to go down??
