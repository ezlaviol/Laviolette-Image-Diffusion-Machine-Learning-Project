2021-08-10T13:44:00+10:00 : Hi KevI'm the same as you, I bought NAB and BOQ for income in retirement, both banks are on the right track and are working on back end system improvements and cost reductions while improving shareholder return. If you look at TT 's comments on NAB and other shares, he's working on making money on shorting stocks and short term gains. It would be good if HotCopper could have different threads for people looking to short stocks and those looking at growth and feedback on growth performance.If the next report is good, I can see NAB going above $27.50 and this being the new share price floor, there is a correction coming and listening to the experts of 5-10%, however they say this is a good thing. Glad to have you on as a NAB shareholder and BEN is a good stock to hold as wellRegardsPEter
