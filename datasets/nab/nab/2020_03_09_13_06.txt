I've dived back in big time over the last couple of weeks, although regretting not waiting until today. People are going to make a killing once this settles down.One thing I'm not understanding is why NAB is getting smacked more than others, normally it's a couple of dollars above ANZ. NAB has always been a great earner dividend wise.
