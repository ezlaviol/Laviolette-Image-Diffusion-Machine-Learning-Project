2016-07-21T19:49:00+10:00 : I haven't bought in yet. I would have been much better off holding and buying some more but as  discussed my bad habit is selling early. I'm still interested. I wouldn't be surprised to see 28-29 before ex div. And I wouldn't be too concerned with the US futures. The US financial sector has performed better than expected. There will be profit taking and some dips but the general trend is up. Ex div dates are still a LONG way off but I don't see nab hitting 25 again anytime soon. I'll start picking up some in September regardless of the price to be averaging in around 3 months before ex date on the 4/11.

What's this about CBA cake?
