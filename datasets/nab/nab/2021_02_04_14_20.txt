Likewise your assumption about by understanding of tech.Block chain is a distributed record of payment much like a debit card records payment between you and a vendor, where are your storing the money? Presumably your bank account. Who's facilitating your blockchain transaction, presumably a bank.To step even further, without a bank how are you going to make a major purchase, say a house, where you are borrowing significant values of money? Who provides those if not a bank or some other lending institution.At this point in time and for the foreseeable future you will still require a bank. They continue to evolve their offerings to adapt to the needs of people but their primary function, to store and lend money has not yet been eroded.When that changes, you are right banks will cease to exist, at least in their current form and structure. Until then, they remain valid investments as an essential tool of everyday life.
