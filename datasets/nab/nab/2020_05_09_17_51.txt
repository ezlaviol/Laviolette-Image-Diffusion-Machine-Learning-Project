So if you held $10K in COH and put down the full 30K, you would only get around $4.1K in shares. If you have a big position in NAB you will probably get most of what you apply for, but for small holders it is likely they won't get much at all - as in the COH and AIA examples. Will wait and see, as I said it will be happy days if I am wrong on this.
