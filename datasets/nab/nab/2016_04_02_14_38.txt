2016-04-02T14:38:00+11:00 : Thanks for getting back Nanood im in the same boat with NAB im sitting at 25.777 as an average im hoping to buy large to drop my average around the 24.00 and 24.50 - 25.00 price range.  Im  just not really sure lower NAB will go to or what way it might be heading. 

I'm happy with my average with ANZ but im not happy that my average with NAB is 25.777.

Thats life i guess, lol.   Whats your thoughts on Monday open for the banks Nanood ?
