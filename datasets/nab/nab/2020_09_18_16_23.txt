If you click on the (blue) 'Download Document' link at the top of this thread, it will open the announcement summary, which has the information you need right on page 1.I see you have declared that you are a current holder, so the answers to your questions are 'yes' you are eligible, and you will be payed 59.29c for each NAB share you own.  As long as you hold shares at what they call the 'record date', you will be eligible for the dividend, even if you were to sell them at some date after the record date. As you will notice, the record date for this distribution is 2 December.You may also be interested to know that you can join the dividend re-investment plan, and you may also benefit from some reading about franking and tax implications.
