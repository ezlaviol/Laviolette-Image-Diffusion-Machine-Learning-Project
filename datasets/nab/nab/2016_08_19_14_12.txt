2016-08-19T14:12:00+10:00 : I would have thought the new storm clouds to affect NAB and all other Aussie banks are serious:

ASIC court case re Swap rates
Possible Royal Commission
Foreign Banks and Hedge Funds circling to use ASIC alleged info to attack all our banks for compensation.
Higher possibility of more cash raisings

all the about point to selling as a better option imo.

All optimists welcomed to say otherwise.
