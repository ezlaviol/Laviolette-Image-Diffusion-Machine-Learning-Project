Clearly im talking to dinosaurs here  .   If you have just held NAB for the last 20 years and think thats ok you are beyond help  . Metrics for funds returns are 10 years and i think thats too long .  So holding through a >60% drawdown is ok , you didnt fear for your beloved NAB during the lehmans collapse . Did you top up fearlessly . Time in market is RISK , why would you hold through a >60% DD when you can smash that terrible risk adjusted return  with significantly less risk with equal returns AT LEAST and a lot more . Stick your head back in the sand and ignore me .
