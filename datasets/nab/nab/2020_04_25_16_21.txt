As has been said, the whole point is to ensure health systems are not overrun which means increased deaths due to inability to provide care to many ailments. 
Sweden is not a good example of handling well. Last figures show they have nearly 2,000 deaths and are currently having close to 200 deaths per day!!
Seems like history will be rewritten and some will now tell us all sorts of wonderful ways it should have been handled.
Lowering  early spikes in cases was the priority to try and avoid  deaths which could have been avoided regardless of age
(Oh and of course infection rate is way higher than reported, most countries had very limited (comparative) testing, a fact well known)
