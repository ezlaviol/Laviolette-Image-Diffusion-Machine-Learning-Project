NAB SP is pretty amusing over the last week. We have the ex-div at the end of next week I think?The div is about 97cents or there abouts?So assuming the NAB price were to be lets call it 33.70c at that time it would fall to roughly 32.70 on the day of ex-div?Alright........because I've got no problems buying more in the 32's. Everytime its gone into the 32's its gone up because thats not fair pricing.But happy to sit back and watch the market have a spaz attack in the meantime.If one didn't know any better they'd think NAB had just released horrific profit downgrades ;-)
