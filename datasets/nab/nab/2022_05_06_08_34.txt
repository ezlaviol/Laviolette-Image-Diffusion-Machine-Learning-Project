Yet, he/she is doing it again. This is a gift that keeps giving and keeps performing. Even if it does dip, the dividends received compensate for the fluctuation..  IMO, I can see this at $35, no problems, considering the tailwinds with the interest rates. But hey, what can one say. Each to their own.
