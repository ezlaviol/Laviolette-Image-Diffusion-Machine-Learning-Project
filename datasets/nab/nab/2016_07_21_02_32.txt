2016-07-21T02:32:00+10:00 : I like those shiny things also. Usually for a quick trade though. PLS, RSG, GXY, 88E were all things I traded recently but only for small money. I was a bit surprised to see yr friend drop below 60c. Some of it may be due to every man with a shovel announcing a lithium find and traders selling PLS looking to take profits and look for faster gains in all the pumps going on. Banks get played too! Missed my 10.2 bid for BOQ. Might still have a shot. Average at 10.53. More green on the Dow tonight. Best run in a long time. Much longer than I expected as you know due to my early sell of my nab and ANZ. Cba doing very well in the run to the div as expected. Ben and BOQ behind that. I'm just waiting for some kind of decent dip to start picking them up again. CBA results will be where they dip or stay strong so I'm waiting for that. Kicking myself for not grabbing cba @low 70's. Cake is looking nice right now . I used to be trigger happy too. Cop a little flak for liking to average down or up but yr first purchase is never yr most important. It's yr second and yr third etc. That's my strategy anyway. I'm assuming yr spread capital isn't all doing well? Hope those turn around if that's the case. I do love the banks. I don't mind making money slowly rather than trying to bag the smaller players I have no experience in. I put that guy you mentioned on ignore ages ago. Not because he has a different opinion but because he offers zero contribution or entertainment and is far too emotional for me to be bothered. I'd even suggest you do the same because I've noticed you seem to be the only person giving him any attention at all. Be safe out there, hope PLS turns around for you
