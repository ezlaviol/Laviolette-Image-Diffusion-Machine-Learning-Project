2019-12-30T18:16:00+11:00 : So I gather your comments are more a feeling than anything measureable? 
"CBA is an old styled public savings bank, Netbank goes down alot,"
Relative to what, how much more than the others?
 "NAB has too many retail branches, BNZ still has too many branches full of nothing but bankers doing God knows and not enough governance."
By what measure? And how is that relevant to being digitally able?

"ANZ and Westpac appear to be the most digitally able."
Again - what do you mean by they "appear" to be the most digitally able?
"They do not appear to have too many branches, seem efficient, perhaps too efficient given their scandals and governance problems, perhaps they need more people not less"
What is the basis to make those comments?  I have recent dealings with a couple of banks and "seem efficient" is very subjective.
