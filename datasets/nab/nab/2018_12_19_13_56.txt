About the only salvation will be that Thorburn will not likely resume after his long service leave. But there are also others who should also be exiting and that includes the Chair. A >80% vote against the REM report is a very clear vote of no confidence in the Board (which has today admitted that it is out of touch) and in the EMT and CEIO. Much rebuilding to be done here and the SP both reflects as well as confirms this (a double edged sword, being equally an opportunity to invest as well as a curse for those who hold).
