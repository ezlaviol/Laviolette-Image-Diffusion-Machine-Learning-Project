I also think the lower valuation (on a PE basis) and large business bank (making NAB the least exposed to the mortgage market of the big 4) mean that NAB is currently the best option for a bank investment (acknowledging that it has traditionally traded at a discount due to being the worst managed in the past). You do need to accept low single digit growth in the short to medium term however.
