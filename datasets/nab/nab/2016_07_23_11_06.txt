The 45 days does not include the day of purchase or the day of sale so you are looking at a complete timeframe of 47 days. So you can't just buy in, sell and then buy into another and jump out to buy into another again. Well, you can do that but you lose the right to the franking credits. For example I think I worked out if you wanted to hold nab and sell on ex div date you would have to hold by the 16th September at the latest. Of course there is no guarantee that when that time comes around your sp will be in a profitable position when the div goes ex. If you sold yr cba now and bought back in you would still get the div but not be able to claim the franked div unless you held for a further period to comply with the 45 day rule. They put a stop to that a long time ago . Nice try though
