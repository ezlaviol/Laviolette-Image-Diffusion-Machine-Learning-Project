2016-02-03T12:45:00+11:00 : Anyone trying this in the last 30 mins and encountered problems or has it been just me?  It keeps saying "The system is currently unavailable and your voting preferences have NOT been recorded. Please try again later."  Logged in to Computershare and my holding is also withheld indicating "company update is in progress".  Is there another way?
