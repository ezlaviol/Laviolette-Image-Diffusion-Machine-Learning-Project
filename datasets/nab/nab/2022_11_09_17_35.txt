I think result did reflect that improving NIM's is not going to be that easy in the short term due to competitive pressure. Remember all our retail banks have gone back to core business since RC so growth at this stage is pretty much limited to organic or market power in a concentrated market so we will see continued pressure to win new business or to poach business. (Obviously higher rates do give many more opportunities to get small increments back and certainly deposits are where it's at short term.)NAB does have a bigger percentage of their book in business banking so can sometimes get out of kilter during some economic cycles but looks much more fully priced than ANZ or WBC although those 2 seem to still have a handbrake applied to some extent. (CBA continues to be market darling in the retailers but looks over priced to me) Sentiment can change quickly and if the market suddenly sees better opportunity in other 2 we may see some transfer out of NAB.Our retail banks are mature businesses who still generate sound cash profits and are significantly better capitalised then ever before under Basel capital adequacy rules so pull backs due to market sentiment can provide buying opportunities, but always best to understand economic conditions (and I don't mean listen to the ever present "chicken littles" of HC).They do tend to operate in cycles and of course we will eventually get back to growth "thought bubbles" which often spell disaster Definitely a sector that still throws up plenty of opportunity to make money. Just don't get hung up on the populist nonsense like worrying about previous highs, you'd swear some of these posters have no idea how the share market works (or perhaps they actually think everyone buys at the highs!!). Been a pretty good ride since NAB was in the Covid low $14's where we saw the bank bashers out in force who couldn't seem to grasp that the banks would still be profitable I am currently reviewing my NAB holdings with a view to reducing in line with all factors including alternate use of funds and of course effect of crystalising CGT but I am not suggesting movement of SP one way or the other!!This is not meant as advice in any way shape or form, everyone will have different circumstances........
