(for NAB to spinoff MLC). cut costs through technology to offset margin squeeze (NAB 2 years into a 3 year program to do this), unfortunately this will results in job losses but that's the way all the big banks are going to go to compete in a digital world.Some things the big banks have going for them over the next few years. entrenched customer loyalty, especially with the older wealthier depositers.. Trump will be re-elected so global downturn will be deferred until he leaves office, so 2023/4 more chance of a major downturn.
