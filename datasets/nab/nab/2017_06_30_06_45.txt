"Since GFC crisis ...to now"	 "...probably near break even on NAB if you include dividends."
Question had nothing to do with CBA (which has obviously performed better over that period) It is nonsense to say NAB is break even (including dividends) since GFC  and I was very interested in your maths supporting your argument......................or whether it was just a throwaway line to support anti NAB view............................

(I see now you want to change it to - Since all time highs - without dividends )
