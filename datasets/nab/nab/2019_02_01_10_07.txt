2019-02-01T10:07:00+11:00 : Just want to add Goldman Sachs have said price target of $31 and no divi cut BUT...Maquarie Group I believe it has said 24.50 is target and thereÂ will be a divi cut...Goldman also added that NAB deals with business banking and it seems everyone is over looking this.Comment made by me only: we have new generations of young bold players who dont want to work for others and will do anything to have their own business, so in turn this will be good for NAB.
