Depending on how the market is, I buy and sell the next day, or same day for a quick profit. After brokerage I usually get between $800-$1200 which to me is reasonable. I bought NAB at $28.42 a day to early this week on Tuesday but I still sold Thursday for $545 profit. I will look for a re-entry on one of the banks next week depending on the market.
