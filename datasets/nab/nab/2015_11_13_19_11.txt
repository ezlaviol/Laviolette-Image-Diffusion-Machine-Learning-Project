2015-11-13T19:11:00+11:00 : Fair enough.

I imagine the volatility of this market would hit a -1% stop quite often, I've lost count of the times I've seen normally lumbering blue chips gap down -1.5% or more in a session recently. Only to be followed by another big leg down the next day.

Nothing is safe, if I was trading I would be short selling and nothing else, this market is death by 1,000 cuts and I feel there are more losses to be had as the blue chips are being re-rated for lower performance across the board, weaker Aussie economy and lower dividends on yielding stocks.
