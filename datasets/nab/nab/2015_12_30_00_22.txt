2015-12-30T00:22:00+11:00 : NAB is becoming a bit of a Humpty Dumpty, it might have a great fall before it gets back on the wall of the January effect.

NAB appears overrated, I doubt some will like the Clydesdale IPO and b4 Jan effect takes hold, it might retrace into the $28s as more pick up CBA and ANZ which appear favored in the sector.
