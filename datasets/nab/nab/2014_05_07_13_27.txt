Totally agree NAB SP defies logic considering ex-div is fast approaching you would think they have made a huge loss. IMO the big boys are really playing with this now and what better to do than trash the price down to the low 33s or 32s only to buy back in a few days.  They win three ways: Up, Down and Dividend. I do wonder where this will settle though after holders dump NAB on ex div day?
