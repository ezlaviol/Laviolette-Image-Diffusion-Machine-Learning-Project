I think the shorters are trolling NAB holders. Dividend is raised, profit is within analyst expectations.Shareprice falls ;-) I'd buy but I think it might continue lower into the 32's. I'll hit up another massive batch at that point to add to the already fairly enormous amount I have.I'm underwater but it doesn't phase me. Its so obvious this stock is being driven lower and it will return to the 35's36's within 1-4 months easy.
