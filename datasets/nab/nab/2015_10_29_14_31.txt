2015-10-29T14:31:00+11:00 : Check out the slaughter on WOW - down almost 10% but at least we can see a reason for that in today's announcement. I have a low buy trigger set there and it is about to be hit so now I need to re-assess where I want my sheckles allocated and make sure I don't shoot too many bullets.

Blue chips are (mostly) under siege at the moment. It makes me wonder what prices will look like if the market gaps down again to sub 5,000 so I'm extremely conscious of the need to keep some powder dry.
