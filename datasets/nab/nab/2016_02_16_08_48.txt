NAB posted unaudited cash earnings of A$1.7 billion  ($1.21 billion) for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It did not give a year-ago comparison in its trading update, which does not provide as much detail as a full earnings statement.  	The ratio of 90-days past due and total impaired assets to gross loans rose to 0.68 percent at end-December from 0.63 at the end of September 2015, reflecting dairy exposures totalling NZ$420 million ($279.34 million). 	Earlier this month, NAB successfully spun off its British arm Clydesdale Bank Plc  by listing it on the London stock market after CEO Andrew Thorburn made exiting from the UK a priority.
