2019-11-20T19:23:00+11:00 : I am holding out to re-invest in NAB as I think the Westpac  debacle might stink enough to affect all bank SP's for the next few months. I can't see any brakes being applied to the SP slide at the moment.I agree that an SP of $25.50 - or even sub $25 is possible as WBC has already stated that things there are worse than what has been reported.Truly tragic situation. I had these shares in my SMSF and I am guessing a lot of people saving for their retirement - or already retired would have a large chunk of their investments in "safe" bank shares as well.However, I won't be too proud to get my shares back at a good price - bank shares will recover over time  and still offer good returns into the future- just maybe a few years off before everything settles down.

Thanks, even a mug can sometimes pick it.Having a fresh look at the chart  I believe that $25.50 is also a possibility, I am keen to add a few more as well.I tend to wait and get some on the up even if I miss out on the bargain at the bottom rather than trying to get the bottom and find it drops some more.
