Question - Has the dividends already been paid or is it due very soon.  

Also what are the chances that these shares are gonna go lower in price then they are already at, or have we hit the botton ? 

Last of all what are people's thoughts the share price will be in comming weeks and by Christmas ?

Love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this stock. 

Cheers
Darren
