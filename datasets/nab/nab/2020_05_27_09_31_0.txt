2020-05-27T09:31:00+10:00 : It's not entirely clear this announcement. If you have say 1000 shares and applied for $30,000 worth of shares how many will you pick up in the SPP?Surely the announcement could say for every 20 shares you have, you will receive 1 new share under the SPP if you applied over and above the $2,500... or whatever the pro-rata equates to.The key question people have is not being answered.
