Director may be brilliant or crap but not sure we should rush in and condemn just yet - all other companies are in the same boat.Immediate reactions are obviously going to be negative. I have to admit in owning the Tassie IO miner shares and I have sold most of my NAB shares to invest there.Remember though, Bank shares are always long term investments and have that stability that no other type of share has.
