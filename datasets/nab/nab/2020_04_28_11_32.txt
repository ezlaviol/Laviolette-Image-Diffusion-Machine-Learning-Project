I would be most interested in exactly how you wanted them to handle their capital and what sort of CET1 capital level you feel they should have had much earlier? (No doubt you also posted this on HC sometime in the last 10 years)
Considering all the Banks are under strict capital requirements please provide links to these much more astute banks that planned for this pandemic. Obviously they would have much higher capital levels.
BTW - I certainly haven't suggested any sort of conspiracy Just interesting to note the sudden capital management experts that have it in for NAB at the moment! 
And not sure what your comment about dividend is all about?
I see future growth potential from these levels. Others don't - that's fine by me
