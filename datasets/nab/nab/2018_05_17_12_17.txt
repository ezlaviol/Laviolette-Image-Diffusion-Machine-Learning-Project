2018-05-17T12:17:00+10:00 : On a tangent here... Before the Clydesdale spinoff, NAB needed to hold aside lump sum for potential litigation in the UK. I am not in a position to look up the figure but I have $600,000,000 AU in my head.
Is that due to come back into the NAB coffers and if so, when? Does anyone have any idea on that?
