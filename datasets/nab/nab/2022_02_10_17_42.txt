2022-02-10T17:42:00+11:00 : Anyone who remembers me as an ultra-bear on NAB, I was wrong and am eating my words as I promised I would.The market clearly loves the result and it looks like Ross McEwan has concocted a re-rating of this bank. Well done NAB holders. Still, why he raised capital at the bottom and paid out CR funds as dividends is beyond me, probably may have been $33+ by now if he didn't do anything.The CET1 ratio looks healthy and so a pay bump can be expected in the May results. I hold CBA/MQG directly and NAB indirectly via ETFs so I hope for everyone's sake it finally breaks its ~$40 ATH by next year and the dividend plumps up nicely to boot.
