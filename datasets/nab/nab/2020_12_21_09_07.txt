2020-12-21T09:07:00+11:00 : HI All,Long term holder here. I am concerned for the health of NAB in the near term. It is a good company with good long term prospects but now it appears to be the weakest of the Big 4. One of the highest Debt to Equity Ratios of any bank: 2.6Net Margins, ROE, ROA are all significantly lower than the other banksRevenue growth has been negative the past 3 yearsI do hope management do a turnaround and can get it back to financial health.
