2020-08-28T10:58:00+10:00 : The big 4 are masked and in disguise and are well ahead of the game. UBank has one of the cheapest home loans and highest SAVINGS interest rates on the market. guess who owns that? A: NAB. Selfwealth is the cheapest broker on the market with over 60,000 portfolios! guess who owns that? A: ANZeBay is extremely expensive but it also owns gumtree the cheapest. my point being it's common practice for the big boys to own a spread of the competition while still maintaining their company and reputation as big annual earners.afterpay still has to be payed just the same as interest free period on the credit card.
