Weren't you saying you wouldn't buy until there was blood on the floor? And then were buying at $24? If you want to call me out then make sure yr post history reflects yr actions. $24 was never blood on the floor for you, yet you were buying at $24. Don't be a hypocrite. Or do be a hypocrite. I don't really care, everytime you have advised caution the sp has gone in the opposite direction. I'm starting to think yr effected by emotional trading as per some of your recent posts when bad bank sentiment is obvious. I've enjoyed your posts positive or negative, but what you have been posting hasn't been matching up with yr trading (that you have posted).
