2020-04-25T16:38:00+10:00 : The epidemiologist was asked for his estimates for the infection rate in the UK and he said about 30 % of people have had it already as it seems highly infectious but for most people it is a mild (his words not mine) disease.  If that proves true many countries may be well on the way to some degree of herd immunity in a fairly short time period.A homeless shelter in the USA tested about 150 people attending and found 76 had it with no symptoms.  In Sweden about 17 % of women going in to an obstetrics clinic tested positive but none had symptoms.We will start to know more very soon as they test the population more widely but it appears as though the virus is a serious disease but can move through the population without creating anything like the 1918 Spanish flu type death rates that Wuhan and Italy suggested initially.So the hunt for the cure is not the only exit strategy.  Moderate degrees of social distancing and protecting vulnerable groups appears increasingly likely to be a practical and likely path forward.
