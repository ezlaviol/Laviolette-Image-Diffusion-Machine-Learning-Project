2020-05-11T12:21:00+10:00 : I commend you on making a sensible decision.My question to NAB shareholders is why? Why do you want to "average" down your holdings in such a low quality business? Don't fall under the illusion here that just because NAB has been hit the fastest it would rebound the strongest. From my observations NAB is always the largest underperformer in bear markets and bull markets, and I would assess that its dividends will be the slowest to recover and quickest to peak versus the others and especially CBA and Macquarie. In fact, if I was holding NAB right now I would consider swapping my holdings at a loss into a higher quality business trading at a discount.
