2018-08-11T11:16:00+10:00 : CBA have just increased their dividend. CBAs financials are very healthy despite being caned after the RC with some of the biggest fines in history. NABs financials IMO will also be healthy and IMO the dividend might be at least $ 1 for this half of the year.

Just remember the Governments proposed corporate tax cuts will be a huge windfall for banking stocks. Banking profits will substantially increase and subsequently further increases in dividends. This is all dependant on  the government retaining power at the next election.
