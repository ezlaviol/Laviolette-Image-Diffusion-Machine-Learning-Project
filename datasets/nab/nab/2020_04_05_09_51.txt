2020-04-05T09:51:00+10:00 : This BS about the entire country being shut down is just that total "BS".
Examples of not being shut down:-

How do we eat every day?
Buy food from companies that can supply us food. WOW, Coles , Aldi, IGA etc....(smaller markets)
Who supplies this food to these companies?
Who supplies the tooth paste, toilet paper?
All of these companies are operating and employing a tonne of people.

Building industry:-
I know people in this industry and it is full steam ahead with many building projects not delayed and are working 5-6 days a week.

Advertising industry.

Banks.

Insurance.

Fund managers.

Local councils.

Hardware stores (Bunnings)

Plumbing supplies.

The various trades - carpenters, plumbers and electrians all still working.

Golf Courses still open with management teams, pro shop managers and course green keepers.

Takeway food/Coffees etc (McDonalds etc)
These business are raking in the bucks.

Petrol stations / Car mechanics.

Bus / Train drivers

Farmers working 24/7 growing crops after the recent rain.

Childcare facilities open for business with Govt assistance.


I could could go on and on listing the business still operating.

On another issue with banks delaying repayments to loans and landlords delaying rent payments, business's will not go into Administration, they will start up again and re-employee most people after COVID-19 has past,

The various Govt welfare packages paying the people who have lost their jobs  and paying employers to keep people in jobs , will allow the economic engine of the country to keep running so when this is all over the Australian economy will get back to the normal fairly quickly.

IMO: Bank shares are a grest BUY right now and hold for 12-24 months and you will be rewarded.
