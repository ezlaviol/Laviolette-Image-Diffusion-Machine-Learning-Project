In my opinion the whole commission hasnt come out swinging the bat hard enough with vague recommendations.
The main take away is that there was a bad profit driven culture over the entire banking system which slowly proliferated over a long time.
I also dont just believe the banks management were to blame _shareholders demanded returns and borrowers wanted money.
I reckon many "upset" borrowers probably knew full well they wouldnt be able to service their debts and probably embellished their application details , the banks are in business to do deals and the competition is fierce.

These two particular individuals are probably the most likely to introduce rapid change rather than those that just say sorry and try to appease everyone
