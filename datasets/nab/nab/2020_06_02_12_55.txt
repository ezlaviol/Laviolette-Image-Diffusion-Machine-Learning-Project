2020-06-02T12:55:00+10:00 : Yep, that's about right - I previously had 3,000, applied for $30k worth, got 838!What pisses me off is I sold some WBC to come up with the cash , that $19k approx that NAB still have of mine would have grown to $22k in the interim as W'pac rose at similar rate to NAB so I've had a nett loss, should have ignored the spp!  But hey, just another group screwing of retail holders while the insto's get the riches.That's it for NAB with me, selling the lot and moving my personal a/c elsewhere as my personal protest!
