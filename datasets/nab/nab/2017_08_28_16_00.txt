If we bought-in at the initial with a good entry price, and the ctr does move-up, then our safety margin will increase and becomes higher and higher as the ctr goes higher and higher.

- A balance point is different for everyone. -

But if an initial entry-point is too high, then the capital loss suffered, though in the form of unrealised loss if you are not selling, tends to weaken an investor's position in terms of the ROI.
