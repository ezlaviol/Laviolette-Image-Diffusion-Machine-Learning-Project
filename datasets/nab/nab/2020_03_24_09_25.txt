You do need to do some research.The SP is a market valuation and that can be for a lot of reasons.The current SP does not reflect the true value of the bank - it is driven by the panic and fears that is current and people liquidating portfolios to hold cash.I also added that the dividend will fall so not sure what you are getting at. BTW: banks are "deferring" interest paymnets for six months - they will still need to be paid off and that will be done by extending the length of the loans. Funds are not lost to the banks.That is why NAB is such a good buy at the moment. The SP has fallen because of outside influences and not any real deterioration in NABs fundamentals

You have clearly no idea how financial markets work.The dividend will reflect the share price ..This is just normal , nothing to do with scare tactics..Your crazy post telling us the dividend level will be retained is just uneducated and dangerous.Alm blue chip companies apart from a few select such as wow and Coles will be going into survival mode.The banks have already highlighted they will suspend loan repayments and the like .I have a holding bought recently, but I would not be buying another share until i hear the dividend forecast announcement, .Hello, even the government's have stated this is a 6 to 12 month period of economic uncertainties.As for comments on down ramping to buy in, wake up to what is ahead mate drifta
