2020-05-15T11:25:00+10:00 : Wage slavery is the starting point. You need something reliable to live on while you increase your wealth. It enables the accumulation of capital which you can invest to increase your wealth.But risk taking is not black and white. You can start from sticking your money in a mattress, and proceed to sticking it in a bank. Neither are entirely risk free (house burns down, bank goes broke), and in both cases you actually go backwards (return less than inflation).The other end of the risk spectrum is effectively gambling, making investments based on soft information (the bartender told me XXXX is going up) or intuition.In between people can find a level of risk they are comfortable with, taking account of their financial resources, capability to recover if the investment fails, quality and history of the companies they want to invest in, diversification of holdings, etc. If done properly, the actual risk is negligible.
