Cash earnings, a measure that excludes one-offs and non-cash accounting items, fell to A$2.50 billion ($1.81 billion) for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with A$2.65 billion a year ago, the bank said in a limited trading update. 	Impaired assets for the quarter rose to A$6.6 billion, compared with A$6.1 billion last year.  ($1 = 1.3848 Australian dollars)
