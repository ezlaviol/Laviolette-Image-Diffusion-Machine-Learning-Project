2023-11-14T11:09:00+11:00 : When I looked at today's NAB share price I noticed that it had dropped by $0.90 per share which is in fact $0.06 over the dividend of $0.84.Considering that NAB announced a share buy back yesterday and all the other major banks share prices are up again today, the Institutional wankers that have forced our share price to this level must be kidding?I wish I had some extra spare cash to buy NAB at todays share price as it won't stay at that low level for very long!
