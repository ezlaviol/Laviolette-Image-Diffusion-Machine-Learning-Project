Not correct I'm afraid, there is nothing to prevent them being dealt with in the same way as the sunhb and benhb securities.
I would agree that at 80 dollars they were expensive, but maybe not at closer to 70.
Comparing the more modern hybrids' interest rates with these directly, can be a bit misleading, as they are very different beasts.
The ha's have the advantage of being not subject to "common equity trigger events" , which have an undefined capacity for cancellation of the more modern securities without compensation.
The dividend stopper provisions are much stronger with the "ha" type.
