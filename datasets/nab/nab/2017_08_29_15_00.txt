2017-08-29T15:00:00+10:00 : Well after a relatively strong period I see NAB today moving down ( -1.8%) more than CBA (-1.2%) at this stage. No bad news for NAB but plenty for CBA perhaps now the issues at CBA are putting a bad smell across the sector? Next few days will tell us more.

What a terrible day for the banks.
