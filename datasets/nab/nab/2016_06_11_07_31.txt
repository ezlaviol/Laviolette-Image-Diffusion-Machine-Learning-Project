2016-06-11T07:31:00+10:00 : My positions taken are quite small. About 1/10th of what I would consider fully invested in an individual stock. I'm definetley hoping for a considerable fall from here or I'll never have a decent portfolio! It's the chance you take when you go in large on the first bite. Been stung by that many times. Less stung now. Good luck on yr purchase, I'm not too concerned about volatility. They go up, then they go down. Before buying anything I was 100% cash which is nice but it does make it harder to make that first buy. And rather than hold just one stock I'll take a few which keeps my mind from being more emotionally effected by ups and downs, and maybe buy another stock in a different sector. All small positions and then work them from there, nice and slowly
