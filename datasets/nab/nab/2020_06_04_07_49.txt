I agree with count the money, I could have easily used the other $7500 to buy on market (or a bull bar) NAB or any other stock.I’ll take my 176 shares and put it in the pile of the others.GLTA.Sadly now the refund goes back to the Minister of Finance and I have to start all those bloody negotiations all over again.  Might go for the bull-bar
