AMP had same issue with UK based arm for which they had no real idea how to manage and it distracted the board yarda, yarda, yarda. AMP Shareholders had pretty much the same deal, HGG CDi's from memory $1.50. Many sold as HGG was touted then as a basket case. Those same HGG are now worth $6.22 and rising.
CYBG have been around for a long long time. Consider the overall state of the UK economy over the past 10-15 years and how it has performed. Consider what you think the world and UK economy will be over the next 10 years and ask yourself whether you think that business when it is run locally by people who better know local markets and conditions will be worth more or less than it is today?
To me a rather easy decision. IMHO in 5 years the combined value of NAB and CYBG will be far greater than the whole today.
