(is that why you posted the depth table ?) rather than actual daily contract sells versus contract buys ?I do not know but a look at yesterdays chart for NAB told me it was a sellers day. That chart was a very easy read. That is why I posted the daily chart. Today is a new day though.  See what happens today.
