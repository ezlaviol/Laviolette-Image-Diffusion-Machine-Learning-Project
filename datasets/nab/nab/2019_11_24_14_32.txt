Westpac now seems the most value, all the bad governance, risk and compliance news having come out and hopefully they now fix it. NAB would appear to also be underpriced along with ANZ, provided that another governance, risk and compliance scandal does not break.NAB is almost priced for another scandal. You would hope that they were getting people in to fix it, if not could be a risky buy.i may take my chances on Monday and buy but the Board and execs of these banks seem horrific, devilish types only in it for the money and that do not learn from their own and industry errors so I do so knowing there is risk.Change my sentiment to buy from sell.
