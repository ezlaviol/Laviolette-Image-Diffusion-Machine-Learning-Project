2017-12-07T17:38:00+11:00 : Mid $30’s.. Sure.. in the future.. Low 30’s are an easy target but I’d really prefer NAB got whacked hard in the short term or even medium term. I’d rather be buying around $26 but in the current hunt for yield that seems like a bit of a daydream. I’d be happy to buy at $29 if it would just move in the right direction. Charts are showing an uptrend so maybe I should just bite the bullet and grab some more...
