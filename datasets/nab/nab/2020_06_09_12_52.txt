2020-06-09T12:52:00+10:00 : I'm shocked at how well some stocks are doing. I'm usually overly optimistic about stock prices. The GFC and other crashes in the recent past seem to have done more comparative equity damage, yet here we are in a global pandemic with absolutely dire economic figures to come, and things are rallying. I was expecting NAB to head closer to the $12 mark. When governments turn the taps off with all the handouts, the sh&% will really hit the fan. It will be interesting to see if people can pay the banks back all that deferred interest in 6 months or 1 years time...I doubt it.
