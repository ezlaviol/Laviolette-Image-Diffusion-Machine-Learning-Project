2015-05-14T12:26:00+10:00 : NAB is not financially sound at all. Never was and never will be. It is poorly managed and deserves to go under. You can see why i would never invest anything into it. If it was of sound mind and body. I would not require constant cash injections (capital raising) on a regular basis to stay a float. If they did not fall under the too big to fail category. They would have shut up shop and gone out of business many moons ago. Propping up poorly managed companies. While letting the struggling hard working mum and pop business go under. Is not the right way to go about it. This only rewards the bad and punishes the good. It creates a unfair equilibrium in the market place. If small business has to rise and fall on its own merits. Then so should the so called too big the fail. It is a disgrace. But what can you expect. Especially when the Government fully supports and helps out the too big to fail. While ignoring those who need the help the most. I will continue to short NAB on the rallies and look forward to its eventual demise. It is not a matter of if, but when this happen.
