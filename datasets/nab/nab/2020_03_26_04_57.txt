With comments from Nobel prize winning professors saying the curve will flatten in a few weeks doing the rounds, maybe the current actions are having the desired effect.On the NAB SP front, US Stimulus package has been passes and the DOW is up 6% (almost 1300 points. ASX might get a kick along today and NAB SP should be in positive territory as well.
