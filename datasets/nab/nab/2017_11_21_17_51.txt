2017-11-21T17:51:00+11:00 : I don't agree this time around. All ords over 6,000 new key level for the market. Their is room for NAB to move on the PE and dividend yield, despite historical norms. NAB is a major part of the index it'll move up with the market. 

This play is of course if you expect the all ords to hover 6,600-6,800 in the next 2 years. 

Market fall NAB will go down to the high $20s as you said.
