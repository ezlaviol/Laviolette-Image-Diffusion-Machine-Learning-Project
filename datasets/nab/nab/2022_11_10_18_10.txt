When specifically reviewing WBC, the Mark Moreland was not complimentary, but it was only when the team turned to NAB, that he came out with (direct quote):"An interesting question is whether the ethical investing funds would buy NAB or Westpac.  When I was reading the report this morning, you read about the unconscionable conduct of the bank, defrauding customers, charging for services not provided, and then being really tardy about fixing it and giving them the money back, and now they're going to get big fines. I think this is really bad!  They're basically saying they're crooks."He then went on to repeat his claims of a couple of months back:"If you look at the share price over time, NAB has been a shocker, and they're ... I think they've been the worst performing bank over the long term."And, I don't happen to agree.
