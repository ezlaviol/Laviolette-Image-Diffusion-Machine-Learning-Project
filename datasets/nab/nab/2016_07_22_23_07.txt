Personally I prefer to try and buy in to the point that buy the time the div gets paid yr in front on the sp even after the div has been paid. That's when I like to exit. Won't be surprised to see cba around 79 by ex div. That would make a nice div for you and a nice profit on the sp. Food for thought.
