This is with all due respect sir.
Whilst I understand your sentiment, I have enclosed a url that I think you might like to watch.

Its called "THE ASCENT OF MONEY" freebie on youtube



I no longer invest, I trade, where else can you buy or sell anything in a matter of seconds.
Trading for me is a gift and i have no faith in the illusion of what we call "The equity markets"

and when I finally realised that, I started to make money.
As someone here has stated "sentiment" is at play here...& that my friend is when you buy, when there is so much bad news and the world is going to hell in a hand basket, YOU BUY !!!
Its fair to say we live in a right wing christian democratic society & apart of the strength of that society is a sound banking institution which is what we have here, so pollies are not going to send them to the hang man, just a wrap across the knuckles to keep the general populous happy until we have yet again another....well you can call them what you want....I call it and orchestrated fiasco...
So they, the banks are a good bet, its just when you buy *?* 
I bought on average thus far at $29.00 plus a div and will buy my last tranche in a few days. 
Why, when you see large sales that are crossed or other wise at the end of day trade, it usually 9 times out of 10 is a sign, who ever has wanted to sell for what ever reason has done so and then the inevitable happens at some point. Ignore the noise and don't think complicated.
I wish you well.
