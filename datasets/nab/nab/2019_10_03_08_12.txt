2019-10-03T08:12:00+10:00 : APRA is cracking down on lending and is adopting a one lending property per person policy, another way Australia is starting to look like it has the policy parameters of Beijing.Can NAB survive the one property per person policy, the one child policy, 31% unemployment rates amongst immigrants, the upcoming fourth recession in the last 28 years in Australia, Ross McEwen, its governance, risk and compliance failings?perhaps it can but there is a lot of risk, not many buyers in the depth (although CBA depth is worse), a very risky proposition.NAB may need someone to increase staff to recover from all these problems, under the Thorburn rationalisation, that may have been where NAB went wrong but it is easier to say that from America.do not think Wall Street behavior has any impact on the recent bank falls but that is obviously only an opinion. Could be argued without any end, that debate of the drivers of a SP fall.
