I hold NAB as a dividend play for some years.  It had a higher yield before and has a higher yield now.  Sometimes also prefer ANZ to CBA and WBC.  It's arrogant to think CBA and WBC are better banks because they are 'pure' Aussie breed, despite that XJO has been under-performing all  major globe market in the past 10 years, including some EMs.  We are still 1000 pts lower than the 2007 high.
