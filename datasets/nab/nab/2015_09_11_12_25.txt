2015-09-11T12:25:00+10:00 : Those numbers look very good.

Of course things can change at the drop of a hat in this environment... But 5.1% tax adjusted yield is very good. I've dipped my toe into WPL this week it's offering 6.1% tax adjusted yield (7.7% gross) and is priced on a P/E around 12 at the moment (NAB has a similar P/E of 13).

I'm keeping most of my powder dry and wondering if the market really cops a beating this month, if the All Ords drops below 5,000 what will we see in the bargain bin if the index gets down to (say) 4,500?
