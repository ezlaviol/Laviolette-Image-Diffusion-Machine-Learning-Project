2019-10-04T06:27:00+10:00 : NAB has already changed the way it passes on dividends reducing the percentage of profits significantly - something like 98% down to 77% - and those figures might not entirely accurate but the level of difference is more so. A lot of what is in your grab has already been factored in. The latest announcement by NAB may impact the next dividend of course - or it may not.Biggest danger is a world recession triggered by trade wars - and none of us know what the future holds there. EVERY PM is obliged to attack banks after interest rate cuts - it is good public relations. They know that economically the banks are caught with the interest rate funding costs but they have to say something.If the economy holds up in 2020 then the CML spin off will be a success for shareholders as well - noted that Stanley Morgan did not mention that.
