You do need better justification to say timing for NAB to start buy-back and spend $2.5b is right.You then mentioned that buyback will be on market so not just insto who benefit but also retail investor can benefits but in the real fact the retail investor are those who buy for long-term unlike insto and day traders. they will not be selling it so this will not help retail investor. Insto bought millions of shares at $14 would simply start selling few millions to make more millions out of our own company and we as a shareholder are now losing as we are paying $10 per shares for nothing... IMO. if bank has so much of capital then they could have simply paid $2 dividend in August including special dividend which would have help more to retail holders. certainly insto will get that as well but at least they only get $2 per share not $10 per share that they will get for this outrageous buyback.... IMO.
