2018-11-02T20:37:00+11:00 : NAB is going EX div next Thursday, looking at the history within a week or 2 of NAB going ex div it usually dips about $2.50 below its stock price before it went EX div.
So that's why ive got a big buy order in at $23.50 in case the same pattern repeats this time.
I think at $23.50 would be a great entry price in the next few weeks if you can get it, fingers crossed I get it.
