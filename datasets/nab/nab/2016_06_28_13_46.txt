2016-06-28T13:46:00+10:00 : I've increased my NAB holdings at just a few pips over $24 this morning - probably a surprise given my overall bearish comments regarding the banks and Brexit, but I figured that if the Aussie banks won't capitulate after the last two trading days overseas then they may well hold up OK.

My overall investment strategy of chasing yield and trying to top-up on stocks at the lower points during the price cycle made the $24 price a bit of buy trigger seeing as it tends to be the low ebb point for NAB when she takes a dive.
