2018-11-02T15:05:00+11:00 : I know it might be hearsay or fearmongering but my old man spoke to a bloke that worked for NAB for 40 years. Even he said based off history NAB cannot maintain this Divy given current market conditions, on top of this and Motley Fool posting about divy cut and also Morgan Stanley make of that what you will.Now, take that with a grain of salt. But again this doesn't mean NAB isn't a great stock. I think NAB is a great long term investment, with or without a dividend cut. With a cut means less cash in pocket but stronger fundamentals in a company, more cash is great but if it has the potential to lead to issues further down the track causing possible SP crash it isn't really worth it?RC penalties have not all been factored in because the look into the banks has not yet finished and even as it approaches completion or final date that's not to say there wont be an extension into the RC.CBA is off loading Financial Advisory and planning services (look at Colonial First State sold to Japanese). Banks trying to get back to basics.I say again though, if you have worked with banks you know that they still make profit off loans, commercial or residential/investment. An considering the recent and slow down of housing boom over east with a lot of loans on issue there is still money to be made. This on top of banks being the bread and butter of an economy I think you would be stupid not to park some money in any of the pillars.
