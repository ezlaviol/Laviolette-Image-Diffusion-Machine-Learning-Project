2020-03-25T08:01:00+11:00 : Phase two of lockdowns have now been implemented, Much more business effected, many more jobs gone. This is going to severely impact the banks especially being the financial institutions bearing the weight of loans not being repaid and huge losses in other sectors. I think we are seeing a short term unrealistic gain as this is about to get much much worse. I should have stuck to my target of $7 to $8 and not bought in yesterday at the low $14, I will sell today and wait.
