NONE, ..83 cents NAB dividend is just few weeks away. trading update few weeks back tell NAB books are increasing nicely...On annual basis, that is more 22% annual return  ( if some one buy NAB share price now and they stays shame(Buy now and just hold for two months and then sell at same price as today)).
