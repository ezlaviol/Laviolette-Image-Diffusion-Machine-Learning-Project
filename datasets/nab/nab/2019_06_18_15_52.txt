2019-06-18T15:52:00+10:00 : I couldnâ€™t find a thread Discussing charting and share price analysis so started one....my charting analysis tells me that NAB has started a long term uptrend at the end of last month (May 2019)....I expect it will get to 29$ by around Sep this year...any other technical analysis gurus in this forum have a view on this please? Fundamentally too NAB is at a historic low PE, seems to be maintaining a pretty healthy dividend....so I bought a couple of thousand shares at an average price of 25.51 before the last dividend of 83c. Hoping my TA is correct and this reaches 29.....GLTAH
