2022-07-23T21:30:00+10:00 : NAB Forecast posted on the 31st May calling Low for the 16th June so we were one day off with the market up over 18% in just over a month.Looks like we could be setting up for Top into the 22nd July so I am going to have a look at a three month Put option atm . The Sept puts seem to have a good amount of open interest but I had a look at the Oct atm puts and the open interest is quite a bit less so will have a more detailed look this evening when I get home . any suggestions on a good three or six month put option , I didnt want to have anything with too short an expiry due to price and time decay so a three month option might suit my parameters as we should be down till mid August . thanks Grant
