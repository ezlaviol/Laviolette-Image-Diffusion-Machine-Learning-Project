Let us pretend one was really, really lazy when it came to investing. In May 2000, NAB was around $25. So this lazy investor bought $10k worth of NAB, ie 400 shares. He then ticked the DRP option. Every year around tax time, he would take the franking credit refund and buy some more NAB, at say DRP prices at the time. What would happen to his investment over the next 18 years, when in the second half of 2018 NAB was $25 once again. Well it would look something like this. (FC = franking credits). CYBG shares were given to NAB holders in Feb 2016 at a ratio of 1:4.




So the $10k investment would now be worth $46.7k. This represents a compound 8.94% growth pa over this time. And with extremely little maintenance (one purchase each year) or skill. Without dividends and franking credits the SP would have to rise from $25 to $116.78 to match this return. Interesting isn't it? And if one takes a little bit of interest in the market and buys the dips (maybe like this one), this return would be significantly better. So CODB!!
