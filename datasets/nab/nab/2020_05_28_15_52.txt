There is still some unanswered questions in what overall economic impact will eventually play out from Covid-19 but there is considerably more optimism at the moment. 
The speed of the rally is because the retail banks were sold down hard and priced closer to worse case scenarios. A reset of expectations have seen prices move back to a more mid range expectation. 
It should be remembered that with the uncertainty they can also quickly reverse and I certainly wouldn't expect them to keep growing at this rate. A return to previous prices may have to wait until we are much further away from the pandemic as bad debts will play out over a bit longer time frame. Our banks however are fundamentally sound with strong capital levels.
There will always be other specific factors but that's how I see the sector sentiment............
