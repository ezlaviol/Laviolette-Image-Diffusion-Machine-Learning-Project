2016-03-16T21:24:00+11:00 : the one thing I use the most to determine where a sp is about to move is a display of confidence in the buy column or lack of in the sell.
that's the number one tool I use.
second tool is the chart itself with a few trend lines.
I'm 50% confident the sp will hit $29 mostly because the chart indicates the sp is starting to flatten around $28 atm but their is still alot of confidence so it could still push to $29.
