2020-04-08T22:35:00+10:00 : Will nab use this period to shut down a big part of their 'cloud transformation' spend, another huge blowout and failure after the NextGenspend of perhaps 1-2 billion?I would think so, and reduce at least a fraction of their opex on IT contractors / consultants.Maybe not HUGE on the bottom line but at least something.
