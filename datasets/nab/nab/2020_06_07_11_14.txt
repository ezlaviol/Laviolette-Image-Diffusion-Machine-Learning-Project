2020-06-07T11:14:00+10:00 : Market sentiment decides where the price goes, and market sentiment is up now.  Mr. Mott is the guy that makes that sentiment happen https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-bank-stocks-020614149.htmlThe ratings upgrade comes after months of UBS revising down the earning forecasts of the banks. But a string of positive economic data over the last few weeks has buoyed confidence and reduced pressure on the big banks, Mott said, resulting in the upgraded rating.“But I also think it's likely that bank shares will underperform the market, over the medium term (and probably the long term), given their constrained growth potential (they don't have much market share left to gobble up, and the economy isn't exactly going to put a fire under house prices or lending growth).”
