I do some casual work from time to time. I enjoy it. Chance to bank some pocket money- spoil the grandkids- add to the trading platform. But how do people live on those sorts of wages? Equity dictates that lower paid workers get an increase. Reality says that the increase will have consequences.This stock is on my radar. Can someone ring a bell when it hits the bottom?IMHO DYOR
