Well I wrote what I wrote in the morning 15mins into the open........that sure didn't take long.Low of 33.35, currently sitting at 34.34basically a $1 turn around in a day.Yeah......NAB wasn't manipulated at all. Financial markets are disgusting.Fortunately it was obvious to all when it was happening but I do pity a few poor retail holders who no doubt got stopped out.I would have if I had of remembered to put one in...Not worth a buy now. Would have loved to triple down at 33.30 which I was pondering but didnt.
