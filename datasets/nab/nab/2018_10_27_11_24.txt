2018-10-27T11:24:00+11:00 : NAB is paying around 10% dividend yield at the current SP . You cant get that anywhere. IMO the dividend wont be reduced anytime soon and if it was it wouldn't be by muchThe high dividend yield is one of the primary reasons why investors buy these stocks. These stocks suit long term investing and the compounding affect of the dividend results in substantial gains over a period of timeHopefully we can get this RC out of the way without too much bureaucratic interference imposed by Government. This should be behind us mid January.In the meantime enjoy your dividends coming mid December. Â  My tip 99 no change in dividend.Stackey
