2020-05-20T17:32:00+10:00 : I think it's a certainty the SPP will be heavily scaled back. The offering size of $500m is tiny given the 570,000 NAB shareholder base. Even if only 1/3rd of NAB shareholders apply for no more than $5000 each, with the remaining 2/3rd ignoring the offer altogether, that's already ~$940m worth of applications. Even under these assumptions, assuming no increase in offer size, that's a 50% scaleback to accommodate everyone. Can't see how this won't be scaled back.
