CBA has really suffered under their Chair, Catherine Livingstone, a Chair with no experience of banking snd look at the result, total chaos and non-compliance.NAB should benefit from CBAâ€™s demise perhaps not as much as the ANZ, WBC and the regionals but NAB should not be the first to fall, A NAB SP of under $28 indicates that the market thinks tough times are ahead as it is a bit low on a PE multiples basis IMHO.
