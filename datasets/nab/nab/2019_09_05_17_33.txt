Your concerns have been noted though, personally, I can't see why as you have no exposure to banks - as a non holder.I will give what you have said some very careful thought when I see the dividend deposit come into the bank account in December. Banks may well be slow and cumbersome beasts but they certainly do not have problems with maintaining a good cream supply.To your credit - you did try very hard.

So you believe the extended terms offered by Humm and Latitude entering the market are unlikely to have any competitive effect on the BNPL sector and you will ignore people such as myself who have had lending experience especially during retail downturns and seeing mortgage payments being delayed etc and my working at Perin Court dealing with slow payers and the lies they tell? Its ok if no one wants to debate the market...usually its because they hiding something but if i were a NAB shareholder i would not be too worried since I know most NAB staff can look after themselves very well and ive met some ex NAB people who should be in jail for the misleading information they peddled in asx reports where people actually lost money and yet they ended up getting a senior advisory roles at ANZ Bank. But sure I agree ignore is a great tool in investment research and economic debate.  Good luck.
