2020-03-10T18:01:00+11:00 : Agree JC - I would be very surprised if NAB cannot get back to its last resting point - $25-26 by mid year and $28 sounds like a good punt by the end of the year.Head winds certainly and non of can say with certainty what happens next week let alone six or 12 months from Now It does seem that NAB is now grossly undervalued.

$27 to $28 is looking good and due to be surpassed IMHO.
