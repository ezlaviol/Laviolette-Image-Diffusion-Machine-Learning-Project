I actually don't believe there is any such things as "low price set-points" or high price set points either. The market takes us where she wants to go and all we can do is try and pick reasonable times to buy and then make hay when given a chance to sell at a decent profit.

I could easily see NAB at $24-$25 within two weeks. Equally I could easily see her at $29-$30 because the market is extremely volatile currently and I don't have the balls to try and predict what she might do next.
