2020-06-12T05:09:00+10:00 : With the DOW currently down by 1700 points, the general market will suffer and $17 might be where NAB settles by close. I am also sitting on the sidelines and will now think very stronly on buying back in. Pull back was coming but I did think after the EOFY so this is a bit early.

Dunno about shorts but I do know this market is a short term traders paradise. I'm sitting on the sidelines all out with around  45k profit from last month. waiting to jump back in. my goal this month is to beat my last months profit when I sell out again. the lower I get it the better. I think it could rally from $11-$16 low this time around (the worse covid gets the better) and anything higher than $17 is too expensive for a buy.
