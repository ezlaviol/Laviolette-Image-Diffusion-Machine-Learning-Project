2020-01-06T12:13:00+11:00 : Have to agree with you there @MissG. We were thinking of changing our home loan from a small bank to NAB, but we gave up with all the BS and incompetence of the NAB Loans officer. Ended up telling our Bank Manager about it at the local footy over a beer and pie. Told me to come in on the Monday and rejigged our loan to a much lower % rate than advertised. 
Tell me what big 4 does that?
