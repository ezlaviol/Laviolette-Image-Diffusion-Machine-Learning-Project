My view is that Buffett does not think now is the time to start buying up stocks, Berkshire has increased its cash levels even more. Buffett seemed sombre. He emphasised that long terms investors should not bet against America, but he has always said that. What was intriguing is that he has not seen fit to go crazy buying the market even though the market has been down because he doesn't think it is cheap and he doesnt know how long term valuations of established businesses are going to be impacted by COVID 19. I think he believes the market rally of April was one big dead cat bounce.
