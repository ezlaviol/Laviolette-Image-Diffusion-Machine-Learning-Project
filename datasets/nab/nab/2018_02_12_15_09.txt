2018-02-12T15:09:00+11:00 : The lesson being: If you've held NAB you've been flogged.

I'm not sure if your figures factor in the divvy (these figures from broker data usually do) but I'll assume they do.

The 3yr & 5yr return is disgusting. The 10yr is terrible. Take it back over 15 or 20yrs I think you'll find it is equally awful.

I've said it before & I'll say it again, holders should be watching CBA like a hawk and looking for a nice swing from NAB into CBA especially around the time penalties/settlements are talked about for money laundering etc.

Even over the last week we have seen NAB + around $1 from her lows and CBA is down around $3 or so.  The numbers are moving in the right direction and once CBA takes her medicine I imagine she will be back in growth mode leaving NAB in the dust once again.

Just my 2c.
