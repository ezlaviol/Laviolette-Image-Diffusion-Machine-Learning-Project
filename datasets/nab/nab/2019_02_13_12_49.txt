I threw it out there to show you how ridiculous it is to just list one business with a down day and claim looming mortgage crisis.Sales might be lower across the board with Sydney and Melbourne to cool off but not in the Perth market. I have a number of tax clients who own a few properties and are adding to their portfolio at present because they know the right time to buy. They work in property, they hold lots of property one does not have heaps of properties if one is stupid.Also sales UP in perth as of February. So its not all doom and gloom like your posts suggest.https://reiwa.com.au/about-us/news/perth-market-snapshot-for-the-week-ending-10-february/
