2015-11-20T14:21:00+11:00 : Not bad for the DRP. My quick summing will have the DRP at $28.58 or thereabouts. Now let's see if this can push up another 10% on the run up to the festive season. With the offload of Clydesdale Q1 2016 it might just give it a small continual boost to gain a new higher support level before half year results 2016.

Wishful thinking?
