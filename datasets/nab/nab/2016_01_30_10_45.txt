2016-01-30T10:45:00+11:00 : NAB's SP might breach $32 this next week I feel sure, it is only 10% away IMHO but pls DYOR. Why sell Clydesdale Bank at the bottom of the cycle when other English banks r doing intraday moves of 4% upwards and more see below:

The closing tick on Wall Street means all Australian domestic banks, insurers, telcos, retailers, oil and gas' if WBC has those in portfolio and materials will go up on Monday at least initially by over 1% at least and for the rest of the week they should continue especially NAB as a massively oversold bank.

Similar companies such as JP Morgan up 3%, Bank of New York up 2.94%, Wells Fargo WFG did 2.64% in a day, BARC up 4% earlier in Europe, HSBC, RBS and LLOY as well went up similar amounts on the FTSE. NAB will be in competition with the other majors, regionals and allfinance companies like SUN on Monday, BEN & SUN have been oversold by about 15% bit like WBC.

The BoJ decision for negative interest rates may be the kick the equities market needs to get off the bottom. No central bank will raise rates now.

In fact u could say that the pressure on Governor Skullhead Stevens might start getting greater to reduce interest rates if property in SYD/MEL does not mean revert and unemployment stays exceptionally high for a developed country of 6% not to mention the homicide rate and rate of social dislocation in Australia.

The unemployed and victims of crime might wonder why RBA sets interest rates so exceptionally high in Australia. A cash rate of 2% is exceptional when compared with the rest of the planet.

NAB should benefit from the RBA, BOJ, EBA, BOE, PBOC and RBNZ rate reductions. The BoJ showed that will be the case IMHO.
