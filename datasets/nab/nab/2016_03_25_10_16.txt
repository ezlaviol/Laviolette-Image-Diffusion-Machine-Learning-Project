Nab was collateral damage and got sold off on the fear they may release similar news. It's crazy though Nab has the smallest exposure to the resource sector out of all big 4.

Half yearly results in a bit over a month will sort out the truth. Until then it's all speculation. Results will determine whether nab is in a down or up trend.
