2019-12-03T20:12:00+11:00 : I think the downturn in the SP over the last few months has more to do with the "flock" mentality with panic selling. While the initial downturn can be explained by the current post RC environment, the last $1.50 probably can't.In any case, I had sold 99% of my holdings and look forward to investing those funds back in when the time is right.Could be very wrong but SP could test $25 before people realise that this is now a true bargain. I'll sit for now and see if that is the case.
