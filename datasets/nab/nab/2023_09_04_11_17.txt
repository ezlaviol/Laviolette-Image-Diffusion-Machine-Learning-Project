2023-09-04T11:17:00+10:00 : Royal Bank of Scotland Group/ NatWest is a big English company in England so you have to look at those records for information on how Ross McEwen performed in England.It does not augur well for NAB IMHO. The Farage scandal that was handed to the McEwen successor, Dame Rose, would have caused quite a scandal if it happened in Australia.How many accounts Has NAB closed?Does NAB allow people to withdraw their funds and close their accounts in cash?
