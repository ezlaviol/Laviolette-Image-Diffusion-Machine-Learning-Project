2015-11-05T12:08:00+11:00 : I may have neglected to include the franking credit in the 99c divvy. Fair call.

The daily low is now $28.51 and I recall they raised capital a little while back at $28.50 p/s (if memory serves) so I'm interested to observe now:
1) Is this cheap? Or will this look expensive in a few weeks time?
2) Will there be a rush of sellers now/soon stopping out at $28.50 because that is what the placement stock was purchased for?
3) Am I making a big mistake increasing my NAB position, should I be buying CBA instead despite the substantially lower divvy yield?

The cosmic ballet continues.
