I bought and accumulated for the first time im my decade long asx trading despite staying away from big 4 till now because with all the headwinds banks will still exist and do business. plus no business is static. They will adopt...hopefully. I have been nab customer since opening my account in grade 6 and I am sure like the rest of us we will have banking accounts forndecades to come. Population is increasing and pie size js gettinf bigger so for long term minded people Nab alongside other big 4 offer a very good entry price to hold over long term and have semi reliable dividends for decades to come.
