2020-04-28T10:43:00+10:00 : Agree. We seem to currently have a barrage of naysayers whose sole focus is current low SP which may be putting some off. (not a bad thing as it will reduce some scale back - more for us)
Current Sp to me is a figure on my PC screen, doesn't bother me, I am more interested in what happens in recovery
If you feel that NAB is destined for the scrap heap and SP will not recover then sure don't buy and you should really sell.
Personally I see this as a (relatively) short term downturn and I will participate in the SPP. I believe NAB is still well positioned when economy gets back on track and has the ability to still generate significant profits. Everything is currently geared to improving capital position and driving through the looming recession. It still has very sound fundamentals.

It should not be forgotten that regardless of much of the nonsense tirades on HC about how bad NAB is, it still has the support of institutions who know a fair bit more about it than the instant experts here....................
