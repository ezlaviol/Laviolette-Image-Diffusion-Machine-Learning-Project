2015-05-13T15:02:00+10:00 : NAB raised cash during the GFC with a share purchase plan ,I think at around $16 and and I purchased more at $18,the banks are better run now than in the 80s when NAB was close to going under but if you are here for the longer term they look ok to me.
I have had NAB since the early 90s when I picked them up for $4 and ANZ for $2.50, the institutions seem to think NAB is ok because they have had an uptake of97%.
In any investment the golden rule is not to all your cash in one company and not all in one sector because sooner or latter you will have a dog.
