If you had it in a term deposit you would still have your $77.50 plus interest.
And if interest rates go down again they will be worth even less. That is why I got out in the $76 range. I brought them because NAB had made it known the were going to do a hybrid issue and I though they might redeem convert them in the new issue of hybrids like Bank of Queensland did.
They still might do that(but if they were going to, that was when they would have done it), they have to buy them back at full price $100, not like someone said at any price,. $70 or $80  Or the can do a new Hybrid issue and swap them. Which would then be worth $100. But not having done that with there new Hybrid issue a few months ago when all the paper work was there, it seems it will be years away if at all
