Hardly any Mum & Dad  selling as their SPP allocation is too small to make any impact on volume (I have not sold mine)...It is called Pump & Dump. When INSTO wants to buys, they can force a stock to trade near bottom for weeks and weeks. When they wants to sell, they Pump the price & Dump the stock and volume sky rockets...It will take a week to see those shorts...(Question :  Why do Brokers heads to work 6 AM rather 9.55 AM ? )
