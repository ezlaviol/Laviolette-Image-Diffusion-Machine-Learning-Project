Mind you I think I will be quietly surprised if the level of economic carnage is not as great or as long as many (justifiable/I do not blame them/I am rather scared myself) doomsayers were asserting.  However, there are winners and losers in this.  There are obvious losers may be offset in part (maybe a third) by the winners.  As the restrictions are lifted I think there may even be a bit of a bounce back up.  As far as the housing market is concerned, if immigration levels are still strong then demand for housing and loans will not suffer as much as many think.  OK Yes, business loans are a problem but what is the recovery like?  What were the LVRs like in the first place?  All will be known in maybe six or mor emonths.
