2017-07-25T14:53:00+10:00 : NAB is a bloody joke, 10yrs ago prior to the GFC it traded as high as $42.63 and now after a decade has passed since then the SP is languishing at a miserable price around the $30 mark whilst the other 3 banks in the top 4 have completely outperformed us in that period.

Lift your game NAB.
