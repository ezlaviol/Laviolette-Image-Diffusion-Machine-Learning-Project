In terms of bouncebacks, ANZ has been the best performer from the lows out of the Big 4 by a country mile.

I'm glad to be at break even though, it was always going to happen and they're still dirt cheap in my opinion.

Like I said my guess is a 5% rally of Banks leading up to Xmas including today, I think we'll be $26 by Xmas at the latest barring any market meltdown.
