2019-12-31T10:28:00+11:00 : JC - it is CBA and NAB that are most advanced - digitally. Maybe not the reason they are suffering with a lower SP. ANZ and WBC have actually declined just as much - if not a bit more.Today for example, the ASX is down because of a 200 point plunge in the DOW overnight. Banks here can't predict those drops but get affected by them nevertheless.All banks are down today - and by about the same amount. There is still a great deal of uncertainty around involving banks - and we all know that the markets abhor uncertainty.

As I said, terrible outcome for CBA and NAB, great for the digitally able ANZ and WBC that appear to be holding up better than CBA and NAB. The market does not think McEwen and Comyn are executing whereas the idea is that Elliott and the new CEO that WBC will have will.NAB has been sold off too much tho, so I change my sentiment to hold from sell.
