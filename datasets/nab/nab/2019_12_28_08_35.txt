Not sure where the individual banks are up to in this regard - though you may be right about ANZ at least - they were pushing to replace branches with on-line banking a decade ago.I think Macchina is on the money though - Achilles heal for the big4 is the increased use of on-line banking options. Sort of brings them back to the pack so to speak.

pretty terrible outcome for NAB and CBA. Great for the digitally able ANZ and WBC.
