2016-04-09T22:24:00+10:00 : Reporting season for US financial sector is about to unfold, and this will (according to reports I've seen) be fairly poor across the board with a few doing ok but most well down.

This is mostly expected but should still place a drag on financials globally, ripple effect likely to drag AU banks lower also.

On the other hand POO bounced nicely last night so our market should be green on Monday... But will we see resources up and banks down? Mr Market doesn't like the banks much this year.

Based on what I'm seeing in the market, I don't think the current price around $25 is cheap, neither is $24 so I won't personally be buying NAB within that price range.
