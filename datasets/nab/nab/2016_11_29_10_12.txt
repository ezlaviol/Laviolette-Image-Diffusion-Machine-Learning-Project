2016-11-29T10:12:00+11:00 : SYDNEY, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator  said on Tuesday it was planning to deny some banks authorisation  to collectively bargain with Apple Inc  AAPL.O  in relation to  its mobile digital payment system.  	The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said  letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital  wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's "Apple  Pay" system, would reduce each individual bank's ability to  negotiate with the U.S. technology giant.  	"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks  to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a  better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are  currently uncertain and may be limited," commission chairman Rod  Sims said in a statement.
