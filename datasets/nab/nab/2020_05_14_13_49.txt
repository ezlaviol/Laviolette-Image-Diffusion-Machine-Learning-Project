2020-05-14T13:49:00+10:00 : the neobanks will face the same challenges as the big four. They might all survive for a decade but as they, just like the big four, face challenges it will come down to the survival of the fittest. I suspect that we might have “the big five” / “the big six” in twenty years or so. There is a reason we have four big banks at the moment. They have been the strongest so far over the centuries, but competition will absolutely be good for them and i am not foreign to investing in that / those neobanks whom will show an outstanding moat, a great management, strength and the ability to withstand a decade or so of challenges. Right now they are financial embryos but I’m sure some of them will grow great and strong, together with the other banks that I’m sure will grow greater and stronger, side by side with the new and upcoming ones.
