Yea, but everyone these days only wants to get rich quick. No staying power.

Innuendos aside, I think some critics are arguing the dividend bonanza the banks have had for a long time is over. We shall see. I think people need to remember things are relative. When you are getting 1-2% for cash in the bank, NIM will be under pressure for the banks, and it is not reasonable to expect record dividend payouts from the banks. Yes the banks may drop their dividends further at the moment, but the advantage in return they have over the cash rate will be maintained. In other words, I am better holding bank shares long term than cash, IMO only of course.
