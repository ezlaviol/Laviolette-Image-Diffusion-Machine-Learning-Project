2020-04-25T16:02:00+10:00 : I was just presenting a different perspective from Sweden's experience where their epidemiologists believe that infection rates in europe and the USA are way higher than the headline confirmed numbers.  Research is emerging suggest the virus is far less dangerous than at first thought.  A month ago it seemed like 10% death rates were coming our way which would have been horrific. I am deeply relueved for everyone.Now ir seems like protecting the elderly and other vulnerable is the main priority which is possible without total lockdown.  That is good news.  But stepping back from a full lockdown will need some acceptance of risk.i don't think that is a particularly controversial bit of commentary.
