2015-05-15T21:06:00+10:00 : Disagree with u on that one, TeTeTe, NAB has capability of a turnaround business model,

NAB has the basis of a very strong all-round bank if management can be strong and move the business in the right direction.

NAB Executive Management need 2 b more forward looking than the Cameron Clyne/ Frank Cicutto regimes & move back to an allrounder moat similar to what Don Argus had:

NAB could have a strong business lending franchise, consumer bank franchise and institutional franchise with NZ and a few cherrypicks in terms of global businesses similar to CBA. It has a lot of potential for re-rating IMHO but pls DYOR.
