This may explain slower delivery than my cheque.My surname starts with a letter between 'A' and 'L' so going by my cheque number, I'm guessing there were in excess of 10000 cheques issued, probably all posted on the same day.  If it was a million cheques, NAB and Computershare might have staggered the mailout but with 10000 one would think it'd be manageable.
