2017-01-09T12:31:00+11:00 : Unsure of NAB due to its extremely strong rally. Agree that along with the regionals, WBC and ANZ should be good picks this year. They do not suffer the priced to perfection tag of CBA or have a BankWest issue. WBC and ANZ have good capital base after selling BTT/ Esanda/ Wealth respectively and have very good yields IMHO. Thinking about adding to BOQ and BEN holdings with WBC or ANZ but not sure about NAB as it has had a sizeable run.

NAB is different to CBA in that CBA's divi yield is stagnating, their PE growth is starting to underperform the other three majors, other than the Australian bank, their geo spread is non existent beyond Auckland, a bit in HK and Indonesia. WBC and ANZ seem far more diverse IMHO but NAB does not really count on the diversity chart but pls DYOR.

Good NIM, large increases in Northern Sydney (where NAB Wealth was formerly based), SE Melbourne (where NAB has a sizeable property portfolio) and Bible Belt Auckland property price rises (BNZ) and Chinese property purchases should all be good for NAB.
