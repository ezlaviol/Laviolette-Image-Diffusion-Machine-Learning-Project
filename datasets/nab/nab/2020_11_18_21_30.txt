2020-11-18T21:30:00+11:00 : The doomers appear wrong yet again. See my posts - buying sub $20s in this, ANZ and WBC. Didn’t touch CBA, never got cheap enough. Buying in times of extreme fear in quality companies has paid off yet again. Sure some other stocks were sold off further with bigger recoveries, however these banks are among the largest caps on the ASX, so can’t expect such a recovery.Plenty here using NAB lows of an illustration of NABs performance as if this was a structural change and would remain at historical lows for the foreseeable future. This is 101 doomsdaying and people like this shouldn’t be in share markets as they can’t handle irrational volatility. Spread your risk in share market crashes across several sectors, you should generally do pretty well. Look for solid balance sheets (NAB was the best post raising) and remove the emotion.
