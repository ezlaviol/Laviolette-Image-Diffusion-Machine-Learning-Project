2019-01-18T13:31:00+11:00 : Could be some bungee jumping in Bank shares when RC report is tabled which I am tipping to be Monday 4th. February. I recon there will be thousands of buyers hoping to pick NAB up cira $24. Volatility could be rampant for a few days then things settle down until May election result. If not chasing div this half maybe wait until share drops after going ex div. Buy low is the name of the game then let your profits run.
