I read somewhere Westpac is going to have one soon and these cash raishings must have a dilution effect and dividends must be reduced at some stage I'd imagine across all banks. And sure these are my predictions only,the predictions of one person out of millions reading HC posts, but you should be pleased to have this one opinion to read from an old out of date codger like me to raise issues no one else will dare raise because they worried about what the majority might think. This HC site is a discussion site and I hope they let me post something I've posted on other sites about the snowflakes at BHP Lol I'll leave NAB now to you optimists.
