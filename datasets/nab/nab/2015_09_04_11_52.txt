2015-09-04T11:52:00+10:00 : So 10 years is 'a very short  view of history'? My point/question was has NAB's recent strategy made it the better buy?

Also something to think about and a point made on the ANZ thread:

'Where on earth do the Bulls think the growth at this point in the cycle is going to come from?'

Anyone have an answer or opinion???
