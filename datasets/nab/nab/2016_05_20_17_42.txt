You could throw in a search to google for housing collapse forecasts in Australia and find its been forecast by "experts" for years. Nab has more business exposure than residential than any other bank in Oz iirc. Not only that, with the changes enforced by APRA the banks are stronger than they have ever been. Remember those changes were forced upon them, not volunteered. As far as the banks were concerned their balance sheets were just fine.

Great businesses. Just need them to be cheaper
