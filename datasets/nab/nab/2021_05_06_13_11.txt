Reaching out to you guys to understand how some of you experts pick stocks, how do you analyse next upcoming hot sectors. Like it was BNPL (I made good money there), then it was Lithium and currently it looks like Uranium is flying.How do you guys analyse it? What tools do you use etc would be greatly appreciated!Thanks In Advance!!
