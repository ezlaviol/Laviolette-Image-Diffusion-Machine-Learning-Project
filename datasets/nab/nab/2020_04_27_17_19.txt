The yield on corporate bonds, for example, can also be rolled over into more bonds. And it compounds. Same with bank interest and every other investment. There is nothing special about dividends other than their canibalism of the underlying company value. CBA since IPO? They were $92 in 2005. Picking a different start date produces a different outcome. Picking the most beneficial is no more relevant than picking the worst. I could match your straw man and say "imagine selling in 2005 and buying CSL or simiar?" You have done well but you could have done so much better. For the record, I sold my CBA in 2017 in the $80 range and bought APT in the $2 range. Why? because the Australian banks are decades behind technologically and are run by second rate managers. There really is nothing special about them.
