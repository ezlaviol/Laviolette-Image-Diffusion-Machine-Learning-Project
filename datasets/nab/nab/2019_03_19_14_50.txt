Interesting that Westpac has just announced that the payment date for its next dividend will be brought forward a little from early July 2019 to late June - actually a lot as it puts this dividend and its associated franking credits in FY19 not FY20 (hence getting them to shareholders before the promised Federal Labor Party change to imputation rules).NAB should consider doing the same !
