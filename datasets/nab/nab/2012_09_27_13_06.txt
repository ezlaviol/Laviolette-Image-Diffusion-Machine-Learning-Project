Yes PML, Freewill has hit it on the nose with the nabhas[see also mblhb].But as well as the interest differential, the perpetual nature of the instruments [see some of the stepped up hybrids, aazpb, svwpa], also brings the price down.That is not to say that the low margin securities are without merit.They do provide some leverage to interest rates changes generally.If interest rates go up, then the return on the nabha's increases by 50% more than the rise in rates. And vice versa of course.So if at any stage you feel interest rates are going up, worth a look.         cheers
