2019-02-13T19:19:00+11:00 : Perth property 3 years ago was rediculously expensive... now it's just expensive. I don't belIeve you can compare perth wIth eastern states as perth basically relies on the mines as Im sure you know. i live in Duncraig, family friends sold their house in Duncraig for around 1 million for a 70's built, half diy Reno mismatched bowl of spaghetti ( I get Duncraig is a good suburb ) I could of purchased a house on a canal on the gold coast for that price.
