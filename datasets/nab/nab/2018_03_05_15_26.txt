Nothing wrong with riding out the cyclical highs & lows of the market whilst banking & reinvesting the excellent dividend yield.

As a buy - can't see anything that says "upside" about the banks including NAB. Sure a couple will outperform but I think most will disappoint, and I personally wouldn't buy NAB pre-divvy.

I just can't see where their growth will come from, I can see real estate cooling, home loan lending tightening, I guess business lending *could* grow but I wouldn't bet on that either.

I think this royal commission and the CBA penalty could easily combine to create the type of Black Swan event for the sector. Although Black Swan events are normally unexpected and unpredictable, I think it *could* easily have such an effect and I don't see any reason to expose myself to that when there are other sectors looking much more robust in the near-medium term.

Just my 2c worth.
