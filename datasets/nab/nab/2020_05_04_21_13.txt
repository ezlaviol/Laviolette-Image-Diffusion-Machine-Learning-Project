2020-05-04T21:13:00+10:00 : In fairness, the likes of CBA, Macquarie, CSL etc. have at least created tremendous wealth for shareholders (which is their job). While not as strong performers, ANZ and Westpac have done okay, notwithstanding Royal Commission issues; but they have kept their banks safe and avoided dilutive capital raisings thus far. In the alternate universe that is NAB, 1) Executives have been paid very well, 2) Shareholder wealth has been ravaged and, 3) As is usually the case, NAB is the capital adequacy laggard and requires a shareholder bailout (yet again). But importantly, executives get paid lavishly.
