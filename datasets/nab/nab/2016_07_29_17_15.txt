Take into account what the sp will be AFTER the div and whether or not you think THAT is a good buy price. To me I'd buy CBA @$70-71. yr average is in the 76's so you need the sp to be $79+ at ex if you want to make a profit on the sp and the div (assuming sell on ex date). Make sure you have yr strategy in place to if you want to hold or not. Coming up to a crucial time for you. I already see profits being taken on the recent CBA div run. If they cut that div then who knows what will happen. When ANZ cut its div it sent the sp soaring. Holders saw it as a good financial move. I think if CBA cuts the div then besides you eating cake I not think the market will take it in a positive light. Then again again CBA might pop $80 in the div lead up. Do I think it will happen? Hell no lol. DO I hope it happens for you? Hell yes. Either way, there is cake to be eaten!
