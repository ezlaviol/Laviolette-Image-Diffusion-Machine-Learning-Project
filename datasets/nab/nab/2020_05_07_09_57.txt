2020-05-07T09:57:00+10:00 : The thoughts that are running though my head at the moment1) The first question is whether you have $30K laying around which you can't use on a better investment. Will NAB get back to $30 and be paying healthy dividends in the next couple of years or is there a better investment.  You need to answer that one.2) Is the recession going to be really bad and share price falls well below the $14.15 some time after the offer closes. i.e. Will you be able to buy NAB shares cheaper than the offer in the next 12 months? 3)  Will the retail offer be extended well above the $500Million and therefore your current shareholdings get devalued further.
