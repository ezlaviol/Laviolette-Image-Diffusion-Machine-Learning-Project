These days IO is in downtrend, banks have bank levy, tls has growth issue, REIT facing property bubble and weak retail  , retail is crap , wage growth , soft oil price

I reckon when "nothing is safe" then  COH and CSL are the best options as their customers are human , and before human become immortal, they all need to use their service. They are not cyclical and gov cannot really touch them
