The country's prudential regulator had asked Westpac Banking  (WBC) , ANZ Group  (ANZ)  and NAB in 2019 to set aside an additional A$500 million each until they strengthen risk management and reimburse customers for wrongly charged fees. 	"APRA is now satisfied that NAB has completed its remediation program and adequately addressed the issues," the regulator said on Wednesday.	   ($1 = 1.5140 Australian dollars)
