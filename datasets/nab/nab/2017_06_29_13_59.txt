In the long still run you will make more money buying for share price growth in undervalued assets. Rather than simply buying for dividends. Since the GFC crisis of 2008 to now. You would probably be near breakeven on NAB if you include dividends. If you think being at breakeven after 10 years of investment is a good deal. Then go right for it. But that's not for me. You would have made more money sticking that into a NAB bank account to receive interest. And with less risk. If you really want to buy something for the dividend and hold. Then i think CBA offers more growth potential especially under $80. Good luck anyhow.
