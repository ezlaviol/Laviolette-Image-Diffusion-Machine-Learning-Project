2015-10-23T15:48:00+11:00 : In all the negative talk about the banks we tend to forget the spin offs from the shareholding itself.
So in WBC I am still holding a small (1109) shares in BTT acquired at $8.20 per share by virtue of our WBC holding.
BTT is on track to close north of $10.60 today.
No particular reason to sell BTT but not a bad result for the 2 or 3 months we've held them.
Know absolutely nothing about Clydesdale apart it from being a drain on NAB but with new management it too may prove a nice little earner.

cheers,
