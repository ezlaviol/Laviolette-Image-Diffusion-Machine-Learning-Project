2017-03-26T10:39:00+11:00 : The return is based on the 90 day bank bill rate + 1.25% margin . The last 90 day bank bill rate dated Feb 2017 was 1.5% which gives it a rate of 2.75 % un franked so to me the only attraction is security. Other than that the only other attraction is the possibility of the bank buying them back at issue value $100. I don't see this happening any time soon hence my question re the sudden interest and increased price. Maybe i am missing something or don't fully understand the financial product
