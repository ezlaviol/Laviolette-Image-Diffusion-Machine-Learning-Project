2020-04-13T16:25:00+10:00 : graphs look great...it all depends on the suburb..the southern areas like Baldivis,Rockingham are down considerably.At the end of the day like shares their only worth what people are willing to pay for it and the situation your in to sell....Timing is everything as I bought in 2014....market dropped in 2018/19 and all the media hype of doom and gloom of the market which adds to pressures on selling.Plus you have the pressure of realestate agents saying it’s a great price to sell in this market...great for them because there only interested in their own pocket ripping you off and then when it’s sold ..like a car salesman you never ever hear or see them again even though your looking for another home...very poor after sales service.Other than that life goes on and I might get a second chance of picking up a little home.
