2020-09-28T10:41:00+10:00 : that happens not cos of small investors and traders like you or me. The ridiculous fluctuations are orchestrated by large investors (organisations) that buy and sell to play the market. In current economic situations, i would purely buy based on Bollinger bands.. buy low and hold (accumulating in these conditions) to sell post covid when market recovers. Buying NAB now is volatile especially cos the gap will close and we know that.. i think plenty of opportunity to buy NAB before Dec at sub $17 (possibly $13 if OCt crash is massive). I say $13 and not sub $10 because the crash is partially factored into current SP imo
