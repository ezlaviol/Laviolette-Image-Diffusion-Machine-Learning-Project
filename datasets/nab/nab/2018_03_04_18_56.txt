I bought DMP on Friday as they showed a strong candlestick signal of Bullish Engulfing.
Bought NAB again  for similar reason.
Also bought into NWS again as they are still on track with their signal.
Also bought WPL yesterday as they are ready to bounce.
Am watching HVN carefully.
How about you?
Post on ASX General if you like as our thread doesn't seem popular with the 'thread watchers' even though ours make so much more sense than most!!
