2017-11-16T12:12:00+11:00 : I thought similar but don't overlook the ~$4 capital return when Clydesdale was sold/spun out.
I hadn't adjust my remaining NAB portfolio average prices/cost base down until only recently.

I'm out for the time being but thought it's worth mentioning. I still like NAB just had to deploy the capital elsewhere and exited at a good price for the past couple of years.

Looking ahead will be interesting to see how the banks go with expected interest rate rises in the US next year and machinations of the local property market. I think NAB is doing great and don't mind that it's a poorly favoured stock as it offers chances to accumulate.
