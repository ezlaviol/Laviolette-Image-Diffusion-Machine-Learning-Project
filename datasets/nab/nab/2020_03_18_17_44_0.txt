2020-03-18T17:44:00+11:00 : I agree - but I was going o tell all about my experience in shopping for toilet paper - with grown adults crawling under the roller doors as they were opening and sprinting to the toilet paper aisle. Shameful and demeaning. Never seen anything like it. Not that we are starving or having a war or anything like that are we?However, as you say @sircorp. The discussion on coronavirus belongs elsewhere and , to be honest, it is such a boring topic now. It is like nothing else is happening in the world.Missed out by a whisker picking up some more NAB shares at $16 - maybe tomorrow.
