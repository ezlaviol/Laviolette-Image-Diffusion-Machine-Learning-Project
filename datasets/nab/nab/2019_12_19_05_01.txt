2019-12-19T05:01:00+11:00 : I'm curious - do you know any public servants? Ones I know are not paid that much and most are hard workers - maybe their bosses get heaps. The Australian myth about over paid public servants is clearly alive and well in your mind anyway. I suggest if you want to make a sweeping statement about ALL of anything that you may want to do your homework first so that you may be a bit more accurate. Which public service department are you referring to I wonder. Agriculture? Defence? I doubt whether they would have much to do with regulating banks.Banks have been shoddy and have pushed the limits in legality - they got caught. Being a denialist won't change that situation. Any business that does that will get nailed and the banks should not be an exception to good governance.I own shares in NAB so maybe we are all feeling the pain of the wrong doing, The banks are at fault so sheet the blame there where it belongs.
