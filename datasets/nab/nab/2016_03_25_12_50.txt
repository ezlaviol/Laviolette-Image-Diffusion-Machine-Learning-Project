2016-03-25T12:50:00+11:00 : Fingers crossed all the banks take a flogging next week. 

The sell off yesterday was no different to a few weeks ago when the banks were target by overseas funds on exactly the same scare scenario as yesterday. An extra $100m of bad debt is nothing to a company like ANZ or NAB and guess what, any bad debt comes off the taxable profits! It amazes me that people are so gullible to think a few extra million is going to make a difference overall but you can go read the short seller comments on some of the threads here predicting doom and gloom. It's a good chance for them to make fast money and a good chance for the investors to buy at great prices so it works both ways.

Share price is sentiment/opportunity. CBA has the largest exposure to the commodity sector and its posting record profits and maintaining dividends. ANZ paying 95c+. NAB 96c. These aren't the actions of companies under any stress but the action of the share price is easy to manipulate to cause stress to the investor to consider selling out of panic. 

Take advantage of negative sentiment when it involves the best companies in the country and considered some of the best in the world. I bought NAB when it dipped a few weeks ago at just over $24. Took my average way down and hopefully it gets there again or lower. My mate bought ANZ at $22 and we both would love to see it get there again or lower.

Hopefully before market open NAB can release a statement of extra costs too 

Don't forget the dividends are already calculated. Accumulating during this downturn means you not only get bargain prices but you also get a better % return per share. ANZ has the best value with 95c+ @$24 and hopefully $23 by Tuesday..
