No chance of that. At some point NAB will have to cut that dividend. By what. 50%, 80%. Or no dividend at all. The only reason why they can still afford to pay these high yields now. Is because the debt funds a lot of that. And through capital raisings. With out of the help of the institutional money injection program. NAB would probably no longer be here. Why anyone want to invest money into a company with their poor financial issues, is beyond me.
