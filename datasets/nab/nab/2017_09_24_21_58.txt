2017-09-24T21:58:00+10:00 : Was just thinking re: Nth Korea, it could also be longer term death by 1,000 cuts like the GFC was rather than a 1987 style fast but painful crushing.

This could play out with the war of words and threats continuing over a longer period of time and each week the market reacts with fear.

E.g. last week Trump talks openly to UN about "total destruction" of NK. 

This week kicks off with Kim Jong Un stating that missile attacks on the USA are "inevitable".

I would expect markets to be quite soft this week and this can go on for an extended time frame.
