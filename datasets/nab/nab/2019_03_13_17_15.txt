The S&P/ASX 200 index  (xjo)  closed down 0.2 percent or 13.6 points to 6,161.20, extending losses for a fourth straight session.   	Investors took some money off the table after the benchmark rose about 9 percent so far this year, fuelled by hopes for a Sino-U.S. trade deal and China's stimulus plans to shore up its cooling economy. The index lost 6.9 percent in 2018. 	Financial stocks led the day's losses, with the sector  .AXFJ  down 0.3 percent. Westpac Banking Corp  (WBC)  fell 0.7 percent and National Australia Bank Ltd  (NAB)  lost 0.4 percent.  	The sector turned down late in Tuesday's session after the federal government said it would no longer seek to abolish hidden commission payments to home loan brokers by banks, reversing a recommendation from an inquiry.   	The healthcare sector  .AXHJ  also ended lower, with drug maker CSL Ltd  (CSL)  down 1.1 percent as the company's shares started trading ex-dividend.  	Pharmacy operator Sigma Healthcare Ltd  (SIG)  slumped 12 percent, the worst performer on the benchmark, after its board rejected a A$727 million ($513 million) takeover bid from  Australian Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  (API) .   	The energy sub-index  .AXEJ  closed down 0.9 percent. Oil and gas explorers Woodside Petroleum Ltd  (WPL)  and Santos Ltd  (STO)  slid 1.3 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.

Newcrest said on Tuesday it entered a joint venture with London-listed Greatland Gold Plc  GGPL.L , a day after announcing plans to buy a 70 percent stake in a Canadian copper and gold mine.   	A new sentiment survey released on Wednesday said Australian consumers have turned gloomy in a one-two punch to the economy already battling a property downturn and anaemic wages growth, raising the risk of an interest rate cut as early as next month.
