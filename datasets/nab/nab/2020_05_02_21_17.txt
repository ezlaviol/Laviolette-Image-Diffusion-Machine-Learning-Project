Yes, you may have worked hard etc, but you were better off - most boomers have made windfall massive gains in property and their children will not be able to buy the properties in the locations that they do. Just as I can admit as a Gen Y, Gen Z will have it harder than me. No-one's blaming you, but it's a fact.
