2023-09-17T09:28:00+10:00 : I think there was big money coming into the market in general.  Was a risk off day and I saw it in a few of my holdings. There will be a pullback Monday, but I am thinking now through to December we may see more days like Friday.  Aussie banks have really done well through this inflation crisis, and forecasts are not affected, so the move out of cash into equities is on.In terms of who the big buyers were, I'm no good with that stuff.NAB to $32, that is my thoughts...... and hope. Good luck Cad's
