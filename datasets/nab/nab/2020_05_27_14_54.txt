If you applied for up to $2500, you'll get up to 176 shares regardless of your current holding2. If you applied for more than $2500, but your pro-rata share is <=176, you'll still get 176 shares.3. If you applied for more than $2500, and your pro-rata share more than 176, you'll get your pro-rata shares.The minimum should mean just that everybody gets at least 176 shares. Pro-rata means everybody gets a fraction of their shareholding, where said fraction includes 1. You'll only get the cap If the fraction of your shareholding is smaller than 176 shares or bigger than 2120. They blew it with the announcement. They should have just said what the fraction was.
