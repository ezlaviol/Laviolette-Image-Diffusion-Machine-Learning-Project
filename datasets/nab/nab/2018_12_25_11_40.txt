2018-12-25T11:40:00+11:00 : Morning folks!  I am an extreme novice at share trading and have just started putting my toe in the water for the first time over the past couple of months.  I have been reading this website with great interest, as I have been able to learn a lot from the comments.  I have decided to try carefully buying shares in companies just prior to the ex-date for dividends (if the price isn't very high) and then selling a few days later (if the price isn't too low), in order to qualify for the dividend.  Has anyone else done this before and is it a good idea, or am I making a novice's mistake?  So, I can see that NAB have just put out a dividend notice for something called "NABPC - CAP NOTE 3-BBSW+3.50% PERP NON-CUM RED T-03-20".  What on earth is this?  Are they ordinary shares and can I expect to be able to buy in and out in order to get the dividend in that way that I was planning?  I'd really appreciate any advice, if anyone's watching this on Christmas Day.
