Re "I'm completely fed up with the crooks that are not just inside big businesses but also sitting in parliament and running the government."


How about this for a policy joke that helps people get off Centre Link. My experience.

I set a Self Managed Super Funds some years before my retirement, all to THEIR rules and regulations and worked out that I could survive on my nest egg. Then came retirement and was working out reasonably well. Then Scott Morrison decided that yes, yes, we need money, some of these retirees are doing too well. They changed the Tapper Rate by, yes a whopping 100%. Have you ever heard of any changes in the Tax System that changes by 100%? So, guess what, off I go to Centre Link to get a part pension to subsidise my living. 

But wait there's more. Now Labour has decided that if the Liberals can rip off the retirees, they can also, "let's take the remaining bit of benefits they have" and take away their Frankin Credits from their dividends in their savings. That's OK, as whatever I lose, I get topped up by Centre Link. 

Ever wonder why Centre Link budget is growing? Not because there are more people that cannot afford their retirement, but because of idiots making policies.
