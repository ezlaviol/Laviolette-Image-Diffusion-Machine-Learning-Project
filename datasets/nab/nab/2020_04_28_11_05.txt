WRT the pricing, as someone has pointed out above the absolute max price that you will pay is $14.15 and that is what the insto's just paid. However, if the price betwen 18th and 22nd May is below this price then you will get them at the avg (VWAP) of that weekly price LESS a 2% discount on top.  Can't go wrong really because all banks are in the same situation regardless of various comment here.
