Yes fair enough. Usually not much point engaging with HC posters who post sweeping negative opinion statements and claim it is detailed analysis
Insinuating NAB is at risk of collapse (some bizarre Lehmann Brothers rating scale) obviously could be extrapolated the poster believes NAB's peers - ANZ & WBC will also collapse as they are pretty much in lock step, structure wise and market wise!! If that has any credibility then looks like Aus has some very serious economic issues so look out... 
(Some real ratings agencies are going to have serious egg on their faces and some fund managers will be mightily annoyed!)
Anyway moving on from that scaremongering my guess is OP is a disgruntled ex employee Or perhaps disgruntled ex customer! (See plenty of them from time to time on various bank threads)
My recommendation to anyone looking at the SPP is do some research (or talk to someone who can provide) and make a decision based on a clear and realistic expectation from where NAB is now and how it fits in your portfolio. 
Discount heavily opinions on HC (either way!!)
