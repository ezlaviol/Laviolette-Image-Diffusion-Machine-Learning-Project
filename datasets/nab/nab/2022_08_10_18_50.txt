2022-08-10T18:50:00+10:00 : then what the blazes are you doing on a sharemarket internet forum  ???it might sound like heaps of money profit to you,  but not for a large company with a market cap of 90 Billion that is highly geared and has to turn over many billions in order to achieve it,  and yet has a pretty ordinary ROE not much above 10% :   which is not the sign of a very profitable company.companies like CSL and REA  have ROE in the 30% +   :  now that's profits.
