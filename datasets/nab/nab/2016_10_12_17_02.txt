The Final Full Year Div will be announced when the Bank announces its Full Year results.

In the announcement it will give:-

- Date the shares go Ex-Dividend (the shares usually drop by a 'similar amount to the dividend') but that's
    not always true.
- Prior to the 'Ex- Div date the shares trade 'Cum-Dividend.

((-Buying in the 'Cum-Div ' period the buyer  gets the dividend))
((-Buying on the 'Ex-Div Date'  the Seller keeps the Div.))

-Date the Dividend is paid to shareholders...

(sorry if I am telling you things you already know !!!)

Keep safe all NAB'ers
