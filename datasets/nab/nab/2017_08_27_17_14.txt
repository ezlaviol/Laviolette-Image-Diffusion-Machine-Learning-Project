2017-08-27T17:14:00+10:00 : Interesting you mention "waiting for a sign" - I've managed to play NAB fairly well over the last 3-4 yrs, buying at more or less the right times. I'm not really an "in and out" trader of this stock I'm a LT accumulator seeking yield + some capital growth.

In my opinion the sign is simply a price around the mid 20's. I look to pick up a few if she approaches $27 and then a few more around each dollar increment lower if she gets there - $26.... $25 etc etc.  The funny (or really sad) thing about NAB is that she has been trading sideways since about 2009 (post GFC) when the SP was $30.

So... IMHO anyone paying $30 or more is simply paying too much for NAB and it's best to wait for those market/sector slips that will throw up a $25-$27 price.

Just my 2c worth.
