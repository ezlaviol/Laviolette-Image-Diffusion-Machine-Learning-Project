Always amazes me on this site tho, the people that think they actually have a better handle on the guess work than others? Listening to people that think the CBA are going to get a trillion dollar fine is a sure fire way of losing your money! I had a part time job for a few years after a long career in Aviation. I met and got to know quite a few Judges and Commissioners . If you think they're much different to you and I,  you are mistaken. I was pleasantly surprised that my previous misconceptions were wrong and how nice some of these guys actually were; real gentleman, some of them. Sensible and pragmatic working within a system.
One thing , I'm guessing is that they would have financial interests too - Bank shares maybe?/ funds in ETF's /Super/whatever? - do you really think they are going to want to see the arse fall out of the Banking system? They know the Banks are the main cogs in driving our economy - what purpose would 'overkill' fines serve? - and they will see to it the punishment will fit the 'misdemeanour' (note: not crime!).
The way this works is that the political football gets a punt down towards the socialist goal of Bank bashing to make Joe Blow happy and then everyone goes back to the bar.  

My guess work is Nabby will work its way back to 34 bucks gradually and CBA will get towards 90 but there will be down days in the next few months when the media hype up the RC and the Bank bashing fines and punters get jittery.
