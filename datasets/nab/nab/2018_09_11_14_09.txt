15 mil per month is a nothing for any of the big 4 but considering there is not much gap between earnings and dividends, it does raise concerns. We will know soon enough if their strategy to hold rates and gain market share offsets this 15m hit to earnings. 

The next couple of months will be telling with factors like housing market stability and further interest rates rises in US, funding costs and of course wage growth and aussie GDP growth.

Thank you for your response.
