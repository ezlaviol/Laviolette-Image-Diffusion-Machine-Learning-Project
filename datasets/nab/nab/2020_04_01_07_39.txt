2020-04-01T07:39:00+11:00 : Hi JC - I think that we will see a couple of months of tighter controls but there will be an end and most people are now acclimatised to the situation.Italy has just extended its lockdown to the 12th April and I can't see much in the way of dissent  there after six weeks. I think, in Australia, we will be looking at the end of May before we see significant roll backs. That is not really a huge time span and the government would be looking at the slowing of the number of reported cases as the method of accepting the moves as a  success.Coronavirus is not the plague after all. To most people, the current situation is an inconvenience and if small businesses are thrown life lines that will enable them to survive then there won't be any social disasters.The panic that seems to be driven purely by fear and greed has been the worst symptom in the current crisis and that will settle down at some stage - and I don't think that is far off.

you think people are going to suffer a police discretionary state in parts of western Sydney, western Melbourne, Queensland, NZ, US and England forever? I doubt it but we will see. The President doesn’t like losing anything, especially a re-election bid IMHO. For NAB’s sake, I hope nothing gunna happen but something possibly will.
