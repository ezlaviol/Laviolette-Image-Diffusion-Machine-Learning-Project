2020-07-10T11:34:00+10:00 : NAB was already operating a hotdesk/work from home model.Generally, working from home is having 0 effect on productivity in most workplaces.  For every employee who is unproductive at home, they are similarly unproductive at work (going to coffees, smoko, etc).  Everyone generally produces the work required. Some over achieve.  Some under and most somwhere in between where their level of productivity is effected more by external factors, than internal.At home, the external factors dont multply.   They are the same.  The difference being is that there is minimal commute.  Staff are more likely to work longer hours to complete a task, because they dont have to "leave to go home" there is no early bird parking, no long commute. This isnt really a factor, as everyone has their targets, and proper managers dont care about he day to day provided the targets are being achieved in a timely fashion.The cost of doing business is more expensive during CORONA from an investment standpoint to set things up.  When technology fails, thats where the inefficiencies lie, but there are ways around this.The real danger for banks is once stimulus runs out.  This will not change, where a model exists, that patient care is more expensive than propping up an economy and it is.  So expect things to continue for the short term.  The share price has already been hit hard.  It wont grow again for a while, and the tide is floating and sinking all boats for now.
