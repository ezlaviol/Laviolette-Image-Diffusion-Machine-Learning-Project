2016-07-02T08:31:00+10:00 : If libs win, I am thinking the market will be green on Monday, but who knows, Mrs Market is especially moody at the moment, and what happened to Brexit, it's like it never happened, for us anyway. 
I keep reading that lots of people are hoarding cash at the moment. If that is true, eventually they will get bored of near zero returns and jump back in the market and push it up. Question is when will this happen?
I am still pretty heavily committed,  and stocks outside the banking sector are distracting me, so nothing to do for me but wait.
