2020-04-30T11:29:00+10:00 : Hard to say, banks will be impacted more long term - lots to take into consideration.Housing declines, super withdrawals, deflation, mortgages not being paid back in full/at all, interest rates low (less people keeping money in banks & loan interest gains are not as large).Could be future opportunities on the horizon, keep in mind these results only factor in 2 weeks of Aus restrictions! We just had a whole month of rising unemployment rates and other government/banking initiatives & benefits to make life easier for us all.I don't think the time is right for banks personally, however, long term all banks will increase in value and be worth more than they are today, you just need to play the waiting game.I will be waiting to go into banks for now. Happy to pay a bit more to know the full scale and extent of the covid impacts.
