2019-02-11T19:03:00+11:00 : Stress DOES NOT mean DEFAULT ?..Agree..One thing sure that Banks will face very little Credit Growth, (May even go negative)...Look at Bendigo Bank Share price today, it lost 7% in one day. Because Growth has died. ..Will other banks follow same fate i.e Zero Growth Rate for years to come ? Most likely yes (Although I am optimistic but Financial Pundit are probably smarter than me, that's why Bendigo Bank got heavily sold today)
