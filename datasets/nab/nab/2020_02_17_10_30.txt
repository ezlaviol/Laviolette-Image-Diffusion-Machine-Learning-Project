2020-02-17T10:30:00+11:00 : (Adds details about the notes issue) 	Feb 17 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd  (NAB)  said on Monday it would raise about A$750 million ($503.93 million) to refinance debt, as it seeks to meet toughened capital requirements. 	NAB said that once issued, the capital notes would qualify as additional Tier 1 capital for the group. 	NAB's capital levels have come under pressure because of the A$2.07 billion it had to pay out to compensate aggrieved customers after an inquiry last year revealed widespread misconduct in the financial sector. 	The country's third-largest lender also launched the resale of capital notes worth A$750 million. 	Last week, the lender posted first-quarter profit of A$1.65 billion, little changed from a year earlier.	   ($1 = 1.4883 Australian dollars)
