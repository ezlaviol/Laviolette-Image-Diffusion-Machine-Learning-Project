You're on an annonymous forum, you can't know what people are doing unless they specifically detail it.Funnily enough investing in the banks was one of the biggest mistakes I made a few years back when I sold some CSL, the banks were starting to get on a SP roll and paying those FF divs.  Big mistake, I managed to get out with a small loss, at least the FF divs made up for the loss plus a bit more.  I consider myself lucky when I look backat the the bank prices then compared to now, I would have had to have done some pretty smart investing with those divs to make up for the bank SP losses now.GLTANABH.
