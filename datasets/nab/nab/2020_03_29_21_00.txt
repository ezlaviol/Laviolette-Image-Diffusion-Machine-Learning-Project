2020-03-29T21:00:00+11:00 : Although NAB is also business orientated, that is very bad news for NAB, absolutely horrendous. I think there needs to be a Government direction for the banking to suspend all loan repayments for 6 months in Australia, as they have made a direction for landlords to suspend all rent charges for six months. If not bank shares like NAB especially could absolutely go to the floor and be worth nothing as properties especially investment properties in Australia become close to next to worthless.No confidence in Australian property could decimate the reason for NAB's SP at these levels potentially forever.Change sentiment from buy to hold.
