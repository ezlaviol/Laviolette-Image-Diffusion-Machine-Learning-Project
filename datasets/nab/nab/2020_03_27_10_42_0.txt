The key factor here is also that without social distancing and reducing the extent and speed of infection we will have long queues of people outside hospitals waiting for respirators. Our health system barely copes when there is nothing going on.  Yet we seem to have lots of money for French submarines, F35 fighter aircraft and money to send troops to places you would never even dream of visiting.
