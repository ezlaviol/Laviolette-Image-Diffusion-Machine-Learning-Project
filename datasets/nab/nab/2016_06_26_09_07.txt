2016-06-26T09:07:00+10:00 : our market was ahead of the FTSE in time zones so i think the ASX was a bit over sold on the day. I topped up a little on NAB, ANZ, TCL because of this although i think the next few weeks will be rocky. We could see the blue chips dive and recover quite quickly during this period of uncertainty.

I think most big traders will wait to see how the FTSE and Dow perform when they open, Tuesday might be a bigger trading day hence this.
