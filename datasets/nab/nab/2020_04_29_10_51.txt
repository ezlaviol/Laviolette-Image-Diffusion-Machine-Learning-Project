2020-04-29T10:51:00+10:00 : That is the biggest load of crap comment I have seen on this forum.We are still in a Bear Market.The fully extent of this Chinese Communist Party lead crisis, due to the incompetence of the WHO will not be realised until the 2nd Quarter earnings come out.People aren't paying their mortgages now. How do you think it will be in 6 months time when the money runs out.They are going to print money into oblivion, devaluing our currency to attempt to prevent the coming recession. Debt is the really problem here and the Coronavirus has just accelerated the collapse.They never fixed the problem back in the GFC, they just kicked the can down the street. All bank shares are going lower and this is due to Capital Raising, Share Dilution.
