2020-10-30T11:25:00+11:00 : Thanks, does that mean I can forget about the 1st account and the shares that had been bought and sold multiple times in earlier years under FIFO principle (still are some shares remain in account), but nominate the new shares bought in 2nd account as sold.Put it in another way, when you just want to carry over the CGT from 1st account (12mth over) from the financial planning perspective, would it be possible to use my other account to play this code instead?
