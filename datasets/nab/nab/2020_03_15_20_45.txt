2020-03-15T20:45:00+11:00 : ..Look at what happened after 2009 Swine Flue, history is repeating same way. ...Few weeks from now, all this will be forgotten and market will back to normal business as happened after swine flue outbreak...Central banks will only buy the main index stocks ?..Hope you understand when one buys Index or ETF, Index Fund must by equivalent amount of equity underneath. That is how Index Work, otherwise system will collapse. Just like Gold Index, one must buy equivalent of Gold Stocks to match the index.... I expect along with ETF & Funds, Future Fund was busy buying on Friday.
