2018-03-26T14:22:00+11:00 : NAB should be a reasonable buy at $26 if the franking credit remains, unfortunately with the politicians we have the voters may decide to vote and elect next year the wrong ones, and us wealthy self supported retirees loosing around $10K of credit will be on the bread line - no too wealthy after all and NAB could go down $24 / $22 and so are the other banks.
