2020-08-02T12:58:00+10:00 : Eric - I really hope that happens. Been putting some cash away and $13 a share will be a tremendous opportunity.Banks are long term investments and even a three year wait for a 100% capital gain and twice the dividend will be way too hard to resist.Please keep talking NAB down - it is really appreciated.
