As I said the banks should not get a bad debt from a margin loan unless they have set a really stupid LVR. The more risky the share the low the LVR for any Margin loan.What is an LVR?Every security in an ASL is assigned a Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) which represents how much you can borrow against that security. LVR is generally based on things like the size of a listed company or managed fund, its financial performance, and how volatile its securities are. For example, if BHP has an LVR of 80% and you want to buy $10,000 worth of shares, the bank will lend $8,000 and you’ll need to fund the remaining $2,000 yourself using cash or other shares.What is a margin call?A margin call is a process to make sure your loan never exceeds your maximum LVR. If your loan to portfolio ratio increases too much (because the shares you’re using as loan collateral have decreased in value) a margin call will be triggered. If you reach a margin call, the lender will ask you to top up your loan with extra cash, or by selling some of your investments.Margin loan accounts generally have a “buffer” of around 5%. The buffer is an additional LVR provided by the lender to allow for small market movements. It gives you some extra time to take action before your loan reaches a margin call.
