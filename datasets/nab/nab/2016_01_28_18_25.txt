2016-01-28T18:25:00+11:00 : Much the same way in terms of thinking except that the holding is just shy of the 2000 small shareholders limit, so I'll be selling Clydesdale into the share sale facility.

Overall, the timing is bad (but that's due to external influences impacting). But as a broader term holder (in between a few periods of past selling at the upper SP levels, before then re-investing again a bit lower down), the contrarian in me suggests that now is about the time to start facing up to a renewed exposure in NAB. So whilst Clydesdale itself doesn't appeal as a hold, buying back into NAB on a post-separation basis does.

This therefore is one of those examples where the union did not fully work out or achieve the best that was on offer, but they can still part as friends, stronger ultimately for the experience, but in the short term, weakened for the effort. That's then a NO to Clydesdale but a YES to NAB.
