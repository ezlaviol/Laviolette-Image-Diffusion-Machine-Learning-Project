2016-03-11T14:28:00+11:00 : Kiwi, on historical earnings they are trading at a p/e approx 12, which is inline with WBC, less than CBA (14) and more than ANZ (10) which suggests that ANZ earns more but not necessarily in cash.. it is the cash profit that matters and the dividend payout ratio for which NAB pays out a whopping 89% of earnings back to shareholders which eclipses the other banks, the closest being CBA at 79%..bottom line being i'm comfortable where NAB sits p/e wise and cash earnings wise against peers
Price wise it's hard to say but I think the 200 day Moving average is the target I'm looking at in the lead up to 1H results ( May) and it appears they don't release a trading update for 1H so we fly blind into the results.. close today and Monday is anyone's guess and much to do with what's happening in O/S markets ! sorry I can't be more specific on this
The biggest issue for Banks is growth, making a profit they do easily, so I see banks drifting with sentiment and at these levels very attractive primarily on a yield basis.. even at $30 and with a 5-10% reduction in dividend, it yields 8% fully franked so I think the buying will continue all be it cautiously..
For traders looking for their 5-10%, this may also present an opportunity purely on CG basis
