2021-01-28T10:58:00+11:00 : It's not just NAB, I worked for one of the Big Four (for too long) and due to staff cuts, I was asked to audit my own work, (which I refused to do) because 'nobody else' knew how it was done.  Too many staff cuts.  Not sure how they got on after I quit.In another case a very new staff member was made responsible for processing a relatively complex loan facility and managed to give one of my customers an extra $400,000.  Luckily, the customer was honest, because the error was not noticed until she raised it.
