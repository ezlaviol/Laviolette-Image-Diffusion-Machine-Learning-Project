2021-07-30T08:37:00+10:00 : if they have to buy-back at $25 then why did the raise fund at $14... someone needs to be sacked from NAB and ASICS should take these company to the court as someone will make a lot of money (instos) buy just giving back millions of shares for 71% profit (10/14 basis)... this is day light robbery of retail investor funds... ! the chairman and entire board including CEO should be shamed and sacked... IMO.
