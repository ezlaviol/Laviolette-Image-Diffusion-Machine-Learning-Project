2020-06-03T11:27:00+10:00 : sold my allocation and thats me officially out.    And I only decided yesterday that I wouldnt sell anything else before 1 July.  Whilst I do hope for holders that it does go to $20 in the short term, I think there are probably more compelling investment opportunities elsewhere at the moment. I may come back to Nab if the price goes down , otherwise good luck to all.
