2018-05-23T17:55:00+10:00 : mini...run... there are about 1 million unemployed who don't get Centrelink benefits who rely on family and savings to survive. Some family members contribute extra from salaries and when a squeeze occurs they change their habits by reducing their saving in super funds and property trusts etc then RC has made lots people more worried and nervous than they would otherwise be, 

then remember the potential cashflow problem if Shorten wins and stuffs up not only negative gearing for houses but also farms, factories, shops, offices people might need to rethink their money situation and outlays under an ALP govt because lots more people are going to worry about banks not extending their overdraft facilities without getting sold up.... are you getting the picture... SCARY STUFF.
