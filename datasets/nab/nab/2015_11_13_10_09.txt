2015-11-13T10:09:00+11:00 : "If you can hit those targets" From your scenario that is best possible outcome.
Have you done this? Do you trade bluechips?

Using your CBA example and a very rubbery $77 SP this morning as I couldn't place an at market order before the open.
$5058 - $310 - $310 = 4438 = 4.438% best possible outcome whilst risking 100k invested.

Even without any brokerage it's around 5%.
Using the lower limit you posted $1220 - 620 = 600

Not a strategy for me, no thank you. Not even going to go into calculating CGT at this point.
