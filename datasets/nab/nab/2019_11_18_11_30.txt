Of the total issue, A$1.18 billion of notes will carry a floating rate, and A$225 million will carry a fixed rate. Both sets of notes will be due in November 2031.  	Australia's biggest banks have been eyeing ways to raise capital ahead of a new core capital ratio requirement of 10.5% by Jan. 1.  	NAB finds itself in a difficult spot, as its the only one of the Big Four banks that is below that level, currently sitting at 10.38%.  	The country's third largest lender earlier this month announced a $1.55 capital raising via a partially underwritten dividend reinvestment plan.  	Westpac Banking Corp  (WBC)  also this month launched a A$2.5 billion capital issue, the largest raising by one of the Big Four since 2015.   	Commonwealth Bank of Australia  (CBA) , the country's top lender, announced a A$2.5 billion notes issue in September. 			 ($1 = 1.4588 Australian dollars)
