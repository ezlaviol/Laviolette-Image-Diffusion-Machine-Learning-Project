Also, NAB announced a few years back that it was developing its on-line banking to match CBA's - including its brokerage division.So the above make a lot of sense. Though, I am surprised to see that CBA is not further ahead given its size in the market.I have rarely visited a branch in the last three years I have to admit but I would definitely mourn the loss of branches being available.
