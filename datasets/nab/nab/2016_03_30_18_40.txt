2016-03-30T18:40:00+11:00 : SYDNEY, March 30 (Reuters) - Mining and trading giant Glencore  has postponed a review of its New Caledonian nickel operations to December from an earlier deadline of June, national French media said on Wednesday. 	Following a meeting on Tuesday between French overseas minister George Pau-Langevin and Glencore's nickel boss Kenny Ives, the miner would give its local unit until year end before appraising its operations, according to the FranceTV website, which did not cite sources. 	The owners of New Caledonia's three smelters-- Glencore, Vale  and Eramet  unit Societe Le Nickel-- are under pressure to suspend or cut output due to a relentless decline in nickel prices that slid to 12-year lows last month.  	Glencore's Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg warned earlier this year the company was reviewing its nickel operations in New Caledonia and Australia, and said that serious decisions would have to be made if the business had not improved by June.   	The French territory of New Caledonia holds one-fourth of the world's nickel reserves. 	Glencore was not immediately able to comment.
