There are all kinds of internal problems which the BRC exposed.Management was was changed but culture has not, now new allegations before authorities and 2 cases of internal fraud before courts.This was supposed to be a $30 stock by now and yet it langishes at at 2008 levels.Management,  obviously not good enough.
