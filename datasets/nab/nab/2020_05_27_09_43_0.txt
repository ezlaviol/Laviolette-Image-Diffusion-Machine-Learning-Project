2020-05-27T09:43:00+10:00 : Massive fail by NAB to read the tea leaves here. Opportunity to make 155,000 eligible shareholders happy and they decided to skimp on the amount and scale people back. The lack of detail in the announcement also shows they just don't care. Apart from those that applied for $2,500 nobody else has any idea how much they will get as it appears some (abt 3000 people) will get their full $30k.So essentially we have seen a $3bn placement to insto's, followed by a quasi Rights Issue of $1.25bn done under cover of the SPP rules. In the end the 600,000+ non insto shareholders have been diluted. See how this washes with the market as i would think the market would have liked the fact NAB raised a total of $5.9bn, rather than $4.25bn in fresh capital. Does anyone seriously think they are not going to need that money ?.
