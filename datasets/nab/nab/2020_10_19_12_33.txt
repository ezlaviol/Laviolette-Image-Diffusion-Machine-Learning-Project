2020-10-19T12:33:00+11:00 : I presume this is on a phone App??
I only use desktop and it is working fine and was only down for a short time this morning.
In fact I haven't experienced many outages at all! (Noting that it's not unusual for various platforms to be out from time to time - only have to read HC)
