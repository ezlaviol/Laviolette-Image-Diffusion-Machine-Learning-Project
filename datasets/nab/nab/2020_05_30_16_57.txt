I.e. you would need to have sold the shares and made a real loss.  Then, adding to what@EricT has indicated, unless you are a trader, the loss cannot be used to offset other forms of income. In that case it can be used to offset other capital gains (on shares) but if they do not exist it can be carried forward to future tax years.  In fact that is my situation at present as I am not a trader and tend to sell shares which are performing poorly and hold onto those which are appreciating.  So typically each year I have a tax loss which gets added on to my existing losses and carried forward.  This tax year, I've sold some of the winners and I'll be able to use up my accumulated tax losses.
