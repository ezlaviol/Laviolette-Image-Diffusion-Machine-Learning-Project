Lord knows I've made more than a few, and for a long time there NAB was looking like one of them.

I don't necessarily agree that NAB is in a better sector or position than TLS though.

As the giant of the telcom/tech sector, they are uniquely positioned to pioneer (and dominate) the next big & exciting technology development. E.g. They have flagged big capex on a new 5G network over the next 3-5yrs and you can imagine what will happen if peeps like you and me can connect to a wireless data network faster than the NBN and requiring no upfront cabling etc.

So... not attempting to cross-promote or change the subject but that's why I'm happy to hold both NAB and TLS (although I'm quite heavy in NAB by comparison).

I personally will be looking to accumulate some TLS shares soon (most likely when they go ex divvy) but would not be inclined to buy NAB at this time. Of course I wouldn't criticise anyone who did buy NAB now - to each his own.
