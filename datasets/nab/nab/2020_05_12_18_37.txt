The mortality rate can only be calculated as deaths per infected people, not deaths per population. Look at Newmarch nursing home, 17 deaths and counting, the seasonal flu has never caused so much devastation. There's no denying it, this is an absolutely brutal disease when contracted by a person "at risk" however you're right, a long term lock-down will cause even more death long term. We have to work smarter and look after our at-risk people.
