2017-07-19T07:55:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, July 19 (Reuters) - Australia's four biggest banks will be required to have Tier 1 capital ratios of 10.5 percent by 2020, the country's  prudential regulator said on Wednesday. 	The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said in a statement that the increase in capital, which is about 100 basis points above December 2016 levels, would allow the banks to meet a benchmark of being "unquestionably strong". 	Australia's four biggest banks include Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and National Australia Bank (NAB).
