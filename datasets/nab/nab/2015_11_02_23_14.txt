Based on the last few trading days, this could easily drop another $1 prior to Thursday (for divvy buying) and that places the SP back around the previous capital raising price of $28.50.

I'll find it hard to resist buying a few more if she goes there... But then if she is likely to go even cheaper Ex-divvy I might just wait it out.
