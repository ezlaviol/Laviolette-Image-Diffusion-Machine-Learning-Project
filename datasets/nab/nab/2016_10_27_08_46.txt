2016-10-27T08:46:00+11:00 : Very good IMHO. NAB lifted its full-year cash earnings 4.2 per cent to $6.48 billion and as u say held its final dividend unchanged at 99 cents. Bad and doubtful debt charges rose 7.0 per cent to $800 million, expenses rose 2.2 per cent and NIM declined two basis points to 1.88 per cent mostly due to higher funding costs. Net profit plummeted 94.4 per cent to $352 million due to the big loss recorded against the sale of Clydesdale Bank in the UK and most of its life insurance business.
No more capital problems on this amount. Should be the best performer in the sector and wonder where the momentum will take NAB $35 - $40?
