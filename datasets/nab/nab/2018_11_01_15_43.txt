This is why NIM is already falling - they can't raise the price to their customers in line with increasing funding costs. Yes there won't be a massive banking crisis but even a default with LMI results in a loss of revenue, which results in lower profits and a falling shareprice. The banks do care about falling property prices. They will get hammered further if they do. Shareholders of the retailers can tell you why there isn't an increase in arrears but there is only so much the belt can be tightened before it cuts off circulation. You think the banks are nimble? Their tech is still 15 years behind, as is their sales model. They can't cut costs. NAB so far haven't cut their headcount at all.
