2020-03-23T14:41:00+11:00 : Current crash has not hit GFC proportions yet. But it will, and then probably exceed that plunge but it makes a handy blueprint for what *might* be unfolding now.Donâ€™t make the mistake of using share prices as your indicator. Us the overall % drop we saw from the GFC firstly on the major indices (e.g. DJIA, AORD, XJO) and then look at the overall % drop we saw in individual stocks during the GFC as another guide.Most major indices blew off around 50% during the GFC, we are currently ballpark -35% so plenty of ground to cover until we reach GFC level of impact.On a share price basis, NAB went from around $41 to a low around $15 so it saw about 60% wiped off the share price. If you take the recent highs of $27 and wiped 60% we would see $11 during this event if the impact was the same as the GFC.NAB is already 50% down from those recent highs. Important to ask ourselves: Can I see the banks (or any bank) turning this around right now & making a run back towards a higher price? Or can I see developments getting worse and the banks being dragged down further? And between those two scenarios, where does the highest probability sit?I know what I think.
