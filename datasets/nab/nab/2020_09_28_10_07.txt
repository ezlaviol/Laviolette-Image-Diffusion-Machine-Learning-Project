2020-09-28T10:07:00+10:00 : Friday trading created a huge gap in the chart. Technical the gap was not a runaway gap as it happened on no news and medium volumes. such gaps always almost certainly close. The gap was create more so because central banks stopped buying gold and turned their attention to USD as they saw that to be of more interest when it fell. The gap could also have been created by traders manipulating. I know a lot of people here would argue that all this happened in view of Vic coming out of lockdown (possible to an extent), but the impact of that is so minimal compared to larger picture. The only question that remains is when will the gap close. I think in the next few days. Today or tomorrow could form an evening star or two spinning tops.. or worse ... October crash expected and almost inevitable at this stage. NAB will see mid 20's but IMO around Dec or early next year.
