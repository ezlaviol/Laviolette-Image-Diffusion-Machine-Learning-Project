2019-02-24T18:39:00+11:00 : Getting rid of the UK business will put NAB back in the running as a competitor - the reality is that NAB is just behind ANZ in capitalisation. As NAB has a  policy of trying increase its position with home loans and matching CBA's on-line site, it could well improve its position in a relatively short time. Lot to be positive about in the NAB space.Your point that size is not an automatic guide to good performance is a very good one.

Yes, NAB was certainly largest, a long time ago, however all have gone through various acquisitions / off loads so a comparison based on changing size is quite ludicrous.NAB has had some acquisition shockers , an early standout being the US foray (Homeside) then of course more recently UK episode. Selling off a poorly performing business technically reduces your overall size however is usually only done to improvc overall performanceConversely NAB's Australian competitors purchased businesses in recent times which increased their size, most notably Westpac taking over St George, CBA, Bankwest etc. Quite a few others, however the point is that overall size is not just a factor of trading performance.I am not sticking up for any NAB bosses however to use a measure such as changing size against peers makes no sense at all.
