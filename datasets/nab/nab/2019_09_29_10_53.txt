2019-09-29T10:53:00+10:00 : Have been invested in all 4 major banks since the 1980â€™s. Yes, many ups and down due to 87 crash, recessions and GFC, but dividend streams and capital gain have been huge. GFC was hardest, had to sell down some for margin calls, but bought back in with rights sub $20, now fully invested again. And yes, banks like NAB have had a good run, but can easily breach $35+ even with dividends likekly to remain at current levels or trimmed a little. Money making machines that MUST be in every portfolio
