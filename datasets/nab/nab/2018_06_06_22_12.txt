Softening housing cycle, more regulation, stricter lending standards, frequent scrutiny, Morgan Stanley predicting NAB to cut its dividend, job & branch cuts which will invite more public & political arropbrium. A likely left wing govt incoming. Plenty of headwinds. I reckon NAB is headed sub 25 or worse. Banks do look cheap but imho there's a way to go yet.
