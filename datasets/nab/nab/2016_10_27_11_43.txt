2016-10-27T11:43:00+11:00 : I'm having trouble getting my head around NAB's share price. It's like the market is pricing in the end of the world as we know it. I was paying these prices 15 years ago for 2/3 the yield. Adding the franked credits to 7% yield gives me 10% return. Even if they cut the future dividend by 10%, it's still better than any bank deposit or term deposit interest. Maybe I'm not seeing the big picture (which is often the case), but as a self-funded retiree, I've just had to buy more this week. It's already up 2% on the price I paid yesterday.

Anyway, happy hunting.
