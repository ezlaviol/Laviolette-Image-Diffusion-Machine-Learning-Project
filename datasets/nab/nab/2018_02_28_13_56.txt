Clearly great minds.............................
I tend to follow candlestick signals as they are pretty reliable.
NAB showed a bullish engulfing signal at the bottom of its range so I jumped in.
I sold yesterday at 30.49 partly because I made a great profit plus the Dow futures looked down which proved to be the case. I will probably jump back in later today unless the Dow futures are right down.
I bought NWS albeit prematurely around 21.45 as they are at the beginning of an ascending scallop candlestick. I should wait till they go through 22 at which time the signal kicks in and they should have another 2 in them.
I probably bought WPL for similar reasons to you. They were hammered down 6, then went ex div after announcing a cap raising. Always a good time to buy WPL.  I bought at 28.57 and stopped out at 28.90. I'm looking to buy back in.
Watching DMP after bad announcement and Director selling shares. Once they stabilise, which should be very soon, I'll get back in.
Also watching NCM carefully, not so much QBE.
Happy trading,
Mikey
