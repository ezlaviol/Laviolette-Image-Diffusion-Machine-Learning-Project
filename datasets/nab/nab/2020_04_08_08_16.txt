NAB’s Board will take APRA’s guidance into account when it considers NAB’s 2020 interim dividend settings as part of the Half Year Results process."
Well that should finally convince some that keep going on about high Divs.
Expect a "material" reduction will be more than 20% for example!!
Edit - Should have said, I am in favour of a major reduction or suspension for one or 2 Divs to keep the Company strong and ensure we are not severely diluted through underwriting. Best for all in the long run.............
