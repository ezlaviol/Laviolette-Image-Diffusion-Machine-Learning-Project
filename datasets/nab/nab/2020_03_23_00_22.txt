Who knows where the bottom is ?Retro-virals (anti malaria combined with antibiotics are being tried out in Sri Lanka and a few other places with good results) but that is post infection.  How effective PM Morrison's nationwide lock down will be is unknown.  When he said this could be in place for 6 months my jaw dropped.Overall, it depends what the loan book is like?  What kind of assets were used by borrowers and how effective the claw back will be from foreclosures.  I could scream if the price of bank shares falls again today.  But I am resigned ot hold obn till I get to my buy in prices.  Then I think I will flick shares all together and hide in some monastery.
