2016-04-07T00:21:00+10:00 : In terms of probabilities (because there are no certainties) the banks should move upwards from here, I would say a 50% chance of adding $1-$2 from here for NAB. 

Probably a 25% chance it will stay the same and 25% chance of being lower.

That probably sounds vague, but longer term (1-5yrs) should be your timeline and you will have a chance to sell for $32+ over that timeline if you wish. Take that to the bank.
