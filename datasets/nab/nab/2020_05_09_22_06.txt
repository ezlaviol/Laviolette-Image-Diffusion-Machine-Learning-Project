REH is not too far above the offer price and most holders who applied for the SPP seemed to get their full allocation. Of course prevailing market conditions are another factor. If these strong conditions continue, it seems unlikely NAB would fall below $14.15 even if all holders got their full allocation. You mentioned AIA and WEB as cases that stayed well above the raising price. I participated in both and I only got a bit of what I applied for in AIA. WEB was a rights issue at a very low price, which is probably why it has traded so far above that price.I don't think there is a hard and fast rule, but a large issuance of new stock can create and overhang that takes weeks or months to resolve.
