2020-05-22T07:58:00+10:00 : I'm not sure that many will be selling out week after next for not that much in profit.  I'm of the belief that most tend to hold for a longer time frame, take the divies and let it build up for a rainy day via DRP.IMO, this country will be in a boom in the next few years, plenty of rain across the country, dams filling, more expected, agriculture looking to have a big run (bloody china and their tariffs might be a spanner...)  and when the pubs and clubs open in the next few weeks the 6 o'clock swill will look like a tea party.6 million on job seeker and gloom and doom, can't remember in my sixty plus years of Aussies missing a chance to go to the pub.Bet the pokie rooms will be going gangbusters as soon as the pubs open.  I'm not one who indulges either, just a trap for dumb animals, IMO.If China choose to ban our beef, we can BBQ our way through it.  Pretty sure you can make veggie burgers out of barley.Come on next Wednesday and the one after.  Should I not get my full application, it will be disappointing, but I can always buy on market with the refund, from those taking quick profits. GLTA
