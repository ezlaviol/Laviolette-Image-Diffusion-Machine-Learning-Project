2019-10-16T14:15:00+11:00 : The Great Recession or GFC as you call it happened once. Interest rates were too high for broker dealers like Lehman Bros. The market reacted and now the S&P is hitting record highs, unemployment in these United States is extremely low and there is record job growth.And the Royal Commission and CBA and NAB? How is fleecing your customers like that sustainable?Compare that with Australia, 4 recessions in 28 years if you work off a per capita basis. 31% unemployment rate for immigrants, the huge number of them, 190,000 per year keeping the economy afloat and interest rates are far too high at 0.75%.Federal Reserve Bank is not great but compared to the fake news RBA and that Philip Lowe character, you would have to say Jerome Powell and the FED leave the RBA for dead.
