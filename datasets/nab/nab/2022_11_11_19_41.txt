Covid came throughout Australia and which bank in Australia can you remind me did the capital raise out of ANZ, NAB, WBC and CBA ? (rest are small bank so don't count them)..... so why is it that NAB's only smartest board member thought to do capital raise ? and that wasn't good enough they end-up started buying back shares issued at $14.15 after share price reached around $27 in less then 2 year ?... lol .... so they can't even think like what CBA did or they don't know what else to do with money with acquisition or expansion ....  ??? if i was insto then definitely i vote for this mobs who gave me shares for $14 roughly and bought back at $28 ... in 2 year like .... who gives you that return in Covid, high inflation, rising interest rates ??? only NAB can i guess in my opinion     ... ! you can't justify based on covid their absolutely waste of shareholder money and dilution in my opinion... but sure you can support them with whatever reasoning you can use to convivence yourself .. as everyone has right to their opinion.. ! so basically important is to vote not necessary how you vote as i am not activist who motivate people to vote in certain way ... i disclose mine and ask everyone to read and vote according to whatever they think is right..> !
