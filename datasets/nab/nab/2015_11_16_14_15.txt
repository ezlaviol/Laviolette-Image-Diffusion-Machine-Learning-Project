2015-11-16T14:15:00+11:00 : Banks are the Backbone of ALL Economies ... so Shorting any Banks  should be Banned !!

Its a dangerous to all economies  .. to Let a few wealthy Shorters   undermine and manipulate the prices of Banks ..  just to Trigger  their Bank Warrants or options  held  ..to move into the Money .

Its all  Wrong ..Evil  ... Selfish  ..Underhanded ...market trading .
to let Bank shares... sway to the whims of a few Large Shorters and their Greedy  trading Tactics.

Options are Fair and legitimate Hedging products ... without the Shorting  needed.

Share markets ..were designed to help Economies and investors Build Wealth and to Attract Seed investment  to fund Expansion and Innovation 

Shorting is the Market Cancer ...  that eats away at the Confidence in that Marketplace to Conduct new listing Business or Hold any positions long term...for Fear of the Short attacks .
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Am I the only one that can see how Evil + Useless bank Shorting is to Everyone  ... not Short.?

Most are Brainwashed by many Brokers encouragement ..wanting the EXTRA  Commissions from Shorters ...regardless of the Economic Impact/Damage it does to Society and Superfunds..

SuperFund Investors.. will still be Drawaing a Part Pension to pay bills etc ..in future years.
Due to Losses  exasperated by the Bank Shorters on their portfolio..today.

Shorters  go on their merry rd of decimation... Until Governments regulators  Wake up to this Evil Undermining of our Confidence in the Economic System...and Markets...and aged  Retirement funding.
