2020-04-06T12:23:00+10:00 : Im not comparing Italy to Australia. They have an older demographic and this I was already aware of. You made my point when you said your in the wings waiting for a coming opportunity.Thus you know as well as I do this is going to get worse before it gets better.I have no agenda here. Im a younger generation Australia but that doesnt stop my fear for my parents or grandparents whos age bracket have higher mortality rates.My grandfather is in his 80s with Asbestosis of the lungs. An has 20% less lung capacity than most. What chance will he have if he gets this?Lockdown measures arent going away anytime soon. Banks are going to struggle to Lend money, struggling families and businessâ€™ are going to want lower interest rates or deferred payments on loans.This is reality, this has not been fully digested by the market.If you dont believe me wait and see
