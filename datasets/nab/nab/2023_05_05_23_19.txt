2023-05-05T23:19:00+10:00 : NAB was just severely overpriced at a growth bank multiple. It never deserved to be high $20s or low $30s, always thought that and it was one of the most expensive multiples globally among the majors. Just rerated to a multiple consistent with peers - ANZ and WBC. CBA is still overvalued. Pretty sure itâ€™s still the most expensive large cap bank on earth.
