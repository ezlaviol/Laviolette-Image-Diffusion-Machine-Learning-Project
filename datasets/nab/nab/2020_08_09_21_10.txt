2020-08-09T21:10:00+10:00 : low interest environment is an absolute killer for the big banks.This is the first time Australian share investors have seen zero interest rates.  I would suggest looking at European and Uk bank shares to see the effect long term zero interest rates have on the banks.UK banks are now trading on 50%-60%  of their NTA, yes thats right!!!To put that in perspective, 50%-60 of NTA for NAB would be around $7-$8.00. 50% down from current share prices.I hold small nominal amounts of NAB, ANZ and WBC, all bought in the last few months.  But they are very small positions, mainly just to keep them on my radar and to be able to participate in any future dilutionary capital raisings if things get tough.The time to get back into Australian banks is just before you think RBA interest rates will rise.  Given the RBA has given clarity that they do not anticipate raising rates for several years, I don't think there is any urgency to buy serious positions in the banks, especially at these prices.
