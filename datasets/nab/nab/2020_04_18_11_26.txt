You have made a bizarre claim and all I did was ask you to explain it, which you can't and you have just fallen back on opinion and personal rhetoric.
The fact is the Appt of McEwen has has not been shown to be a disaster compared with other banks in the same time frame which was your claim!!
(You're the only one showing bias and also your ludicrous questions about why the graph starts in Nov also shows your on an agenda not fact based)
