2017-11-03T19:25:00+11:00 : Why do you say it's a horrible result mate? Generally in line with analyst expectations although growth was a little in the low side, the numbers are so big that 2.5% doesn't seem awful to me. I think consensus expectation was 3% so I can see that is a fair margin away.

I haven't closely examined the results yet but was there something negative that stood out for you?
