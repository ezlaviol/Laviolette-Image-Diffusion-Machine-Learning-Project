in addition s&p, what a joke that is, are these the same guys that rated all the instruments circulating out there before the GFC, and now post GFC and all the other crap the media present such as grexit, brexit so on and so on, we are meant to believe their views and opinions.

one thing I can say with a great degree of certainty is all these ratings agency are trying to make up for the mess they created, so now they have gone from one extreme to the other and are now completely risk averse.

end of the day I trade based on my own opinion of how I interpret all the noise created by the media and other various agenda based agencies.

I personally feel the banks have remained rather resilient at the current moment. I feel there is a lot of money sitting on the sidelines at the minute waiting to flow back into the banks.
