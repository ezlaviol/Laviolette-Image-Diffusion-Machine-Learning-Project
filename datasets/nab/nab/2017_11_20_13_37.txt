2017-11-20T13:37:00+11:00 : You're not serious bro. Apart from slipping below $30 just last week (by a slim margin so I'll let that one slide) she was sub $30 June/July/August this year and again about 11 months ago, that time she was sub $30 for a period of around one year.

If you bring up the 3yr chart, just a glance at it will tell you she has spent around half that time sub $30.
