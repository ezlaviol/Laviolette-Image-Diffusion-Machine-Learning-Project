Maybe a dead cat bounce but encouraging nevertheless. The bank that caused the current panic selling did not fare well today so their punishment continues.Next week may well see a retrace in the SP to higher levels and given the over reaction to ALL bank shares, I thing we could see an accelerated rise heading in towards Christmas.

I believe NAB will hit $28 by Christmas.It is clearly the best out of the majors: the least tarnished.
