Shares are not risk free and we’ve just had a hit harder than the gfc due to something out of the banks control. Prefer a sound business going forward than a train wreck because it decided to pay out $3bn in dividends. Sell some shares for the equivalent of the dividend if you wish. Also never ever hold purely 1 sector. Big no. NAB will recover. As will others.
