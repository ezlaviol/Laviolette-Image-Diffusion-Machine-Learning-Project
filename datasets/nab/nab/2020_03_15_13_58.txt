2020-03-15T13:58:00+11:00 : Let us compare US vs Aus Rally on Friday..For example On Friday US Banks rallied on average by 18% up (Chart Attached)...While on ASX out banks were hardly up by 2%. Westpac Bank at NYSE was up by 9.2% (Attached)..My estimate is Chance of ASX either staying same place where on Friday are (50%) or going up (30%) and going down (20%)...My Estimate is on Monday, chance of ASX staying is positive territory are much higher than going in negative territory ........
