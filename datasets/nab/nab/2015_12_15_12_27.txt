I only have a few hundred shares so I'm trying to work out whether to bother holding or just sell them through the sale facility. If my CDIs are going to be worth 50 bucks, it's hardly worth my while holding them.

It seems the final price won't be decided until the institutional component is finalised but somebody must have crunched the numbers for a ballpark figure of the value of these CDIs.
