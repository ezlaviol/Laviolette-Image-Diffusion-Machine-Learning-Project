2020-03-15T19:15:00+11:00 : NAB is now trading below the bottom of GFC even below 1998 share price. ..Since 1997 & 2008 GFC, NAB earning/profit has risen substantially. ..At current price, NAB is bargain, that's why you, me and 100 others are on NAB forum. ..Only difference is some on forum holds NAB, some wants to buy bit cheaper but they all want to buy NAB and hold NAB for long term. Why ?....
