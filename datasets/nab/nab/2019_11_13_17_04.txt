That is where we disagree  If the China - US "trade war" had not happened, NAB would have an SP over $30.Banks will survive nicely - maybe another two years before they start to firm again and SP will drop below $28 tomorrow and may take a bit of time to get back to current levels. In the end the MLC spin-off will entice investors into NAB until that happens.

Thanks for the info MissG,   i am in the camp of disagreeing with UBS view.I think the BIG4 banks will transition themselves successfully by. removing unprofitable or unaligned businesses. (for NAB to spinoff MLC). cut costs through technology to offset margin squeeze (NAB 2 years into a 3 year program to do this), unfortunately this will results in job losses but that's the way all the big banks are going to go to compete in a digital world.Some things the big banks have going for them over the next few years. entrenched customer loyalty, especially with the older wealthier depositers.. Trump will be re-elected so global downturn will be deferred until he leaves office, so 2023/4 more chance of a major downturn.
