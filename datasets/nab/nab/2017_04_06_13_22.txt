Agreed that NAB should be safer due to their lower exposure to this risk than the rest of them. In the event of a house price correction NAB would still take a hit though. I only have 10% in banks of my share portfolio, NAB primarily, which apparently is much less than the norm, however I still think its probably a bit high...
