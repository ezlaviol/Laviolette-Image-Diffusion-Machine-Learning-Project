Guess what people just borrowed more money and paid a higher price for the same house instead of being sensible and making a rational decision on it's worth. The bank said they could borrow xyz so that's what they did.

This is the stupidest I've heard yet to tackle the housing affordability issue. Besides it could never be funded. Say someone has a million dollar mortgage for PPOR, you are handing them straight up a $25k annual tax deduction presuming 5% interest rate with your 50% reduction. Impossible policy to fund and you'll be left with egg on your face when they expected increase in spending and GST revenue from it never eventuates.
