I feel you may be correct on this.The few articles/commentary I've seen on this subject are quickly written off as 'doom and gloom' and so on, which i think is a little silly.Been searching far and wide for an honest forecast, and it feels like there is simply too many interests at play (beneficiaries)that simply will not admit that it may in fact be exposed and susceptible to a major downfall.One simple factor in all this.... being, no one quite knows what's ahead.A little humility is what's required.
