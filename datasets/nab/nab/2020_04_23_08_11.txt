It's possible, but I'd rate it highly unlikely in the short term - even during the crash of 1929, the drop of 89% took place over the course of about three years. But even if they do, I cannot for a second believe that they'd be closed down for more than a couple of days.As for NAB specifically, I don't know if we've seen the bottom yet or not. I suspect there's still room for the market to fall a bit further, but I don't see it going much lower than it already has. I'm less interested in trying to time the bottom of the market than I am in picking up decent shares at a good price, and I think that all four of the big banks, right now, are good value for the long term investor. There's likely to be more rough waters ahead; that, plus my uncertain job situation in the near term, has me sitting on the sidelines for now. But I certainly wouldn't call it a bad move to jump in at this level. It's entirely your call, based upon your financial situation and comfort with risk.
