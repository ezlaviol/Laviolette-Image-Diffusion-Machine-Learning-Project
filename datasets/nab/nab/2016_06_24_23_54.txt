2016-06-24T23:54:00+10:00 : My course was decided three days ago. Holding over the referendum was a calculated risk that didn't pay off. Looks like I will be holding for a while now ( maybe a few decades??), but you never know. At least the dividends will keep me warm, if they last. 
On a serious note, FTSE is now down only 3.4%, though some of the banks are down 20%! So maybe $20 might be around the corner! Good for everyone that can take advantage of it. I can still get some benefit of it myself, so that is even better. I am still, just, green on BEN and BOQ is only just red. I also grabbed some gold three days ago which has worked out quite well, though I didn't get enough to cover the NAB paper loss. So swings and roundabouts. 
Not much else to do now except sit back and "enjoy" the ride, tightly strapped in. Where it stops nobody knows. But as I am now committed to holding, I am worried about Trump!
