2019-05-16T22:34:00+10:00 : What's wrong with NAB?When trying to answer that questione, firstly I'd look for the obvious explanation, NAB went Ex-div this week, so falls were expected.Secondly I'd make a comparison with other banks to see if it was the sector or company specific?Most of the banks moving together, falling on market open.SO?I reckon it's got more to do with the 'trade wars' and comments traded between USA and China about tariffs. IMO just following the market moves overnight. Check out the 5 day chart below.Note that WBC went Ex-div and moved lower when the others didn't. Now look at the moves where CBA, NAB and ANZ moved together but neither of the others went ex-div. Taking that into consideration, do you still think NAB is doing poorly?
