2019-05-17T08:56:00+10:00 : I accumulated more NAB cum dividend, and yes it dropped some $1.20 the next day to reflect this payout. I often see this when a stock goes ex dividend, and with fully franked shares they appear to fall reflecting the dividend price and franking credit in total. In any event, you will find in the short to medium term subject to normalised markets that share prices will reclaim the lost dividend in their pricing. Hence, I expect NAB to claw back to $25-$26 by August/September. My thesis going forward with bank stocks is the following:1. They will shrink to simpler banking models without wealth management2. They will continue to write down impairments to reflect RC requirements ie compensation, but this is now slowing3. Dividends will continue at current levels, barring any major recession or housing collapse4. Technology and cost cutting (less branches and staff) will underpin profits and maintain margins5. Love or hate them, our banks are among the best captilised in the world and MUST be in every portfolio
