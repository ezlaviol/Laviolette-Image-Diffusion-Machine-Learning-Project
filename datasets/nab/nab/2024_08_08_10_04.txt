2024-08-08T10:04:00+10:00 : Japan is currently facing significant economic distress.

In percentage terms, the index finished over 12% lower, its sharpest one-day drop since the infamous "Black Monday" in October 1987.

This comes as the Bank of Japan is increasing its rates to curb inflation, which in turn strengthens the yen against the U.S. dollar, diminishing the appeal of Japanese exports.Concurrently, technology stocks are suffering due to a mix of inconsistent earnings and growing doubts among investors about the overhyped artificial intelligence sector and fears of a U.S. recession.

Nasdaq futures dropped by 4%, while Dow futures and S&P 500 futures decreased by 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively.
