It minimises risk to be buying when people are forced to sell (at a discount) and selling when people are forced to buy.  NAB was literally forced to sell shares because of temporary APRA rule revisions, not having quite a strong enough balance sheet and them along with others thinking the Aussie housing market was going to take a tumble and having higher bad debt provisions.  They are now literally forced to buy because they have nothing else to do with the excess cash the RBA gave them via the term funding facility (that didn't really make its way to the economy as allegedly intended) and APRA's terrible timing again on revisions - hence NAB sells shares at the bottom and buys them back at the top.On market share buy-backs always cause short term spikes but when they're done its back to the metrics of the business.  Its the usual monetary lag, banks now awash with cash, that's pushing these.  I'd be holding onto it myself, but Australian banks know the RBA will be there to bail them again if they fall.  Low mortgage interest rates; extra savings from not spending on holidays; and generous income support from government and housing market support specifically, drove property prices arguably higher than they would have risen under a no-Covid scenario.  The RBA is beginning the process to taper.  So will the US at Jackson Hole in August.  Market interest rates will drift up.  There is little Federal Gov' support coming this time.  This is what makes a market of course.  Banks were very undervalued in April 2020, whereas here you are buying at fully valued premium as we stand on the edge of a potential sustained bout of depressed economic activity in Australia.  I'd call buying them on that basis very risky.
