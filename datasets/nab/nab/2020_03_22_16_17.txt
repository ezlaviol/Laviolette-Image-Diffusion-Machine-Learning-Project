2020-03-22T16:17:00+11:00 : Just listening to the news and virtually all states are about to close borders. NSW wants almost a complete shutdown for 48 hours and Vic wants to close schools on Tuesday (and that may flow on to other states.Your observation @Bert333 about shops may be right. Supermarkets are almost stripped and we forget about Toilet paper shortages - Both supermarkets I went to today just don't any supplies at all..I suspect that the fall on the ASX tomorrow will be much greater percentage wise than the sell off on the DOW on FRiday.

Lock down measures being ratcheted up. NSW and VIC schools may close. I have noticed increased panic buying in the supermarkets has a direct relationship with selling on the ASX. This good second stimulus package by the Government may not be a enough. I think SP will drop under $15 tomorrow.
