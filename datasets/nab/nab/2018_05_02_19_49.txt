2018-05-02T19:49:00+10:00 : With all the costs coming into the business as a result of the Royal Commission and all of the governance, risk and compliance, this result tomorrow will probably be as good as it gets or will get ever.

If you put costs in, you will reduce the profit earnings.

If you do not put costs in, you will get capital slugs like CBA, divestments like ANZ, fines, penalties, Court cases like Westpac, it never ends.

Toronto Dominion is preferred to a Wells Fargo situation, a Lehmanâ€™s or a Royal Bank Of Scotland, Halifax Bank Of Scotland, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Countrywide or AIG.

Pain today may make a better tomorrow for NAB.
