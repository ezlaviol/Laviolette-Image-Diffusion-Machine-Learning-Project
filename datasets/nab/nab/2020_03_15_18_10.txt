2020-03-15T18:10:00+11:00 : about 2pm i looked at the Australian on line and saw a small headline in the markets area.  It said the RBA has stepped in.  I was busy at work and only glanced again near the close and was shocked to see the All Ord had gone from -10% or so to + 3% or so.  Falling knives like that do not reverse on a dime to that extent through any normal market process.  In a 1987 crash scenario such an intervention could stop a crash in its tracks.  But with supply and demand heading for the toilet for months, a pump or two like Friday may create a brief visual but will not help businesses with no customers or workers with no income.
