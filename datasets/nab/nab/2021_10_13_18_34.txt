2021-10-13T18:34:00+11:00 : Im disappointed with NAB buyback. I invested into it for the buyback, and have been left hanging while i couldve made large profits in BOQ, IFL, YAL, PRN, DEG, etc...and when I sell it, it will rise again (~10 Nov being one important upcoming date). Wasted investment at this point, and if/when it finally moves it might barely make me feel better. If I wanted to sit around like an idiot for 6 months I couldve just bought a few k worth of ETOs. Useless.
