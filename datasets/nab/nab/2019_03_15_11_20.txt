Australia's fourth-largest bank said it would extend its definition of small businesses to those with aggregate borrowings of less than A$5 million ($3.5 million), up from less than A$3 million. 	In its final report last month, the government-mandated inquiry recommended banks be required to broaden the definition of small businesses so that more borrowers would benefit from protections when they experienced hardship.  	NAB acting CEO Philip Chronican said the company had completed or was in the process of implementing 26 of the inquiry's 76 recommendations.	  	($1 = 1.4148 Australian dollars)
