2019-06-16T16:05:00+10:00 : Appears that NAB is having a courageous time trying to get its sponsorship right like the other banks:ANZ has the NZ Cricket Team, one of the four contenders in the Men's World CupCBA has the women's Australian Cricket Team, which let us face it has shown more humility and decorum than the Men's side.Westpac has the St-George Illawarra Super League side and the Queensland Reds (who just beat a NZ side for the first time in years)Then there is the hapless NAB with Sam Kerr, her "suck on that one" comment, the Stajcic sacking problems and the general lack of support that the Matildas get from well, just about everyone? I wonder how many Aussies will be silently hoping Jamaica win or at least draw?NAB certainly is one of a kind on the sponsorship front. Bit like the party they sponsored?
