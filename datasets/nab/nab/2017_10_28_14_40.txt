I largely agree with your sentiment, however $50 mil cost appears to be a favourable outcome.

Compare with ANZ who apparently provisioned for $200+ mil and released announcement this week that their settlement was "largely covered by the provisioning held".

Happy to hear other thoughts from anyone with insights to the matter.
