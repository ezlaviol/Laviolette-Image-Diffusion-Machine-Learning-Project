2019-12-04T17:06:00+11:00 : Indeed - topped up a little bit today at start of trade for  $24.90 - which just happens to be the closing price.The downside is getting more compressed and whe the next dividend comes around in July, I expect the SP to be much more healthy. Goes down a bit in the short term - so what?

buy in stages, does not matter it may go down further. once it bounces it just take a few days time.
