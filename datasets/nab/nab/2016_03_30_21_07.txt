You could have done worse than buy ANZ and NAB in my opinion.

I spent 50 large myself today, my first foray into any of the big four, 1,000 ANZ and 1,000 NAB.

Who knows if the price will go lower in the short term, but i'm confident in the long term they will keep paying nice fat dividends.

Tim Boreham, criterion from The Australian, rates ANZ a buy today.
