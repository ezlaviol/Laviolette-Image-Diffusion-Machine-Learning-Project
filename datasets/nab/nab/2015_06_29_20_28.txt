I am patient. This is a cash investment for now which is intended for the longer term if need be and I only started buying at what I perceive to be value, ie $72 or less.

Believe that interest rates will stay the same in the medium term and even if lower will only be likely to be a quarter of a basis point.

I believe this one compares well to many others on the market in terms of risk profile and potential reward for a low risk investment.

Particularly given the recent significant drop.

Do respect your opinion and reasoning though, but have gone the other direction for the reasons above
