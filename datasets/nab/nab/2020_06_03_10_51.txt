How in earth you decide to buy without reading the finer details ie issuance etc is beyond me.I currently only hold 500 shares and got the minimum allocation even though I applied for $7.5k (more wishful thinking given the no of retail shareholders).If you only got the minimum allocation but had applied for $30k, why do you think you should be entitled to a full allocation given your existing holding is way below the $30k you applied for. If you want to holding that value buy on market. You got what you we’re entitled to and no more.
