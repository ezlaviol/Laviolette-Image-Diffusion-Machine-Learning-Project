2018-10-13T06:58:00+11:00 : NAB sp is approx. 20% down year on year but per what was reported during May '18
1H18 v 1H17 - Cash earnings $2,759m down 16 %
1H18 v 1H17 - Cash earnings (ex restructuring-related costs) $3,289m Flat

Perhaps the sp was more reflective of the 1H18 v 1H17 Cash earnings with restructuring related costs?
