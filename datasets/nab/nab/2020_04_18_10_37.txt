2020-04-18T10:37:00+10:00 : So the Ross McEwen time as CEO both for staff and sholders has been an absolute disaster. do not want to say I told everyone so but it has been a disaster as predicted even compared with all the other banks.Putting characters like the ex AMP Simon McKeon has helped turn it down than turn it around.I hear NAB advertises itself as “more than money”, what is it about, job cuts, profit cuts, dividend cuts, SP cuts, lending cuts, leadership effectiveness cuts?Turning down rather than turning around?Change my sentiment from buy to hold.
