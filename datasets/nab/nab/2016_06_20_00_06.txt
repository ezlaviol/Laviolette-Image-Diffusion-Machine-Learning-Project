2016-06-20T00:06:00+10:00 : I suspect political uncertainty will continue to weight on NAB until after our election.

It is generally assumed LNP will win government (they are paying 6:1 to win), but i believe its much closer than is being reported in MSM. Three of five polling companies have it 51:49 to ALP, one 51:49 to LNP, and one 50:50.
LNP could win a majority with 50:50, ALP need 51% to win majority, and something in between is likely a hung parliament.
But its a difficult election to predict, the only thing im certain of is the cross bench will grow, which increases the chance of a minority government (or a new election)
 - there are record numbers of voters who will be giving minor parties their primary vote
 - NXT could take 3 LNP seats in SA
 - Extra large swing in WA
 - An independent like Winsor, Oakshot or another wildcard might getup

If LNP dont win a majority they will find it difficult to form a minority government (they arenâ€™t good at negotiating, which is how this election came about), it will also be difficult for the ALP form a minority government as they will have less seats than LNP. So there is going to be general uncertainty while this plays out over the next month.

If ALP does form a minority government there will likely be a royal commission into banks, which wont be good for NAB.

I dont think this uncertainty is priced into the market at the moment, so im going to hold off buying for now.

(DISCLAIMER: im pretty one sided politically, so i might not be seeing things objectively)
