2020-05-10T13:17:00+10:00 : My opinion is that NAB and their management expect the share price will fall below the SPP ask.That is why there is that 2% discount if it does.Then there is the question of cancelling future dividends, that could hold for a couple of years.After some thought, i have decided to add to my BHP and RIO stocks.No SPP for me.For me it is always "the glass in half empty", a natural born pessimist, the best kind.I hold 2,320 shares of NAB at a break even price of $25.97.If i entered the SPP, my average would be reduced to $23.30.Then there is "in my own opinion" NAB management stink and should all face criminal charges.Jail the bastards !!!!
