2019-02-05T10:29:00+11:00 : NAB personality profile: A bunch of <people>, who now want to tell us that deep down they are really nice guys.<…>  …. words were altered to satisfy the mods.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I recall many years ago (on my retirement) being invited to a NAB retirement forum, complete with sandwiches and non alcoholic drinks. My wife and I trotted along to learn words of wisdom.A NAB "advisor" told me that we can comfortably use our retirement nest egg as collateral in order to borrow money to buy another investment property. The guy was completely unconcerned about client financial risk. If I had not already done part of a post graduate course in financial investment, I may have taken his advice more seriously.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The problem in Australia is that the punishment for financial crimes is way too lenient. Often sentences are set to run concurrently, and the judge considers the defendant to be a "nice guy" who made a mistake. Judges in Australia should be more aggressive in making sentences CONSECUTIVE (i.e. cumulative), like in the United States and China. In China the cumulation of sentences would probably justify the death penalty.This is not the result of a series accidental corporate errors. NAB is a company that has been infiltrated by ORGANIZED CRIME. The CEO and the chairman are bosses of a syndicate, and need to be processed accordingly. Decades in jail and relegating their families to poverty is an appropriate punishment may deter other similarly adventurous fraudsters.------I am amazed that even though the royal commission was given a very tight brief, it could still dig up so much information. What would be uncovered if the enquiry had a broader scope and went longer?
