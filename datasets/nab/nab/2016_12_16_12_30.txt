2016-12-16T12:30:00+11:00 : I don't want to jinx it, but NAB is finally holding her own against the other big banks and for the first time (at least in my recollection) NAB has outperformed CBA over the previous 12 month period, by a reasonable margin.

It would be great for holders if we were to see that unfold as the trend over the next 3, 5 and 10 yrs.

Wait and see.
