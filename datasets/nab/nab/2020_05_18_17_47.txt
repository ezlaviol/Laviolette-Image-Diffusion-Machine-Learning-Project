The economy is on a serious downtrend and I doubt it will be like the V recovery we saw during the GFC.,I was going to apply for the full $30k, but it's like catching a falling knife, so I might hedge my bets and apply for less, so I can buy parcels on the way the to the bottom.For those people thinking there might be a scaleback...the very recent QBE spp finished undersubscribed yet many posters were talking about a scaleback
