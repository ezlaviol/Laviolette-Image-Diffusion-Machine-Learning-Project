2020-06-06T13:49:00+10:00 : could be much higher at need of the week IMHO. high $20s and early $30s beckons as the market picks up all the pent up demand, Roaring 2020s economic recovery, return to full employment, digital and banks like Citigroup up over 5% earlier today return to their former profit margins and former glory.NAB much maligned should recover despite management and may resume its $30 levels IMHO.
