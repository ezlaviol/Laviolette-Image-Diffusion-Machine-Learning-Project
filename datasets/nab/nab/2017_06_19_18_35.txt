2017-06-19T18:35:00+10:00 : SYDNEY, June 19 (Reuters) - Moody's on Monday downgraded 12  Australian banks, including the country's top four major  lenders, reflecting elevated risks in the household sector.  	Such risk was heightening the sensitivity of the banks'  credit profiles to an adverse shock, according to the ratings  agency.  	Moody's said Australia and New Zealand Banking Group   (ANZ) , Commonwealth Bank of Australia  (CBA) , National  Australia Bank  (NAB)  an Westpac Banking Corp  (WBC)  were  downgraded to Aa3 from Aa2.  	The Australian government has taken steps in recent months  to cool the red-hot property market amid concerns that  speculation in housing could ultimately hurt consumers, banks  and the economy. House prices in Sydney and Melbourne have more  than doubled since 2009.
