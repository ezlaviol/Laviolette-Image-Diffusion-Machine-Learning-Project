2019-05-02T21:43:00+10:00 : I averaged down once or twice earlier, and then the price fell again. Hence, I stopped averaging down, sat back and preferred to watch from the sidelines for now. Would prefer to catch the floor rather than a falling knife.Why accumulate here when there are other better counters out there to go for ? The BIg 4 banks are NOT the only counters in the ASX. JMHO,...My MYS has not fallen much.My DDR has grown a lot, though I kept averaging-up. I diversified my holdings into a few sectors,... hence no fear there,.... I'm glad I practised diversification,.. within and outside of the banking sector.
