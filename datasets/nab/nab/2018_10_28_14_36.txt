2018-10-28T14:36:00+11:00 : Nab has gone from a yearly high of $32.98 to a yearly low on Friday of $24.52 and a close of $24.70.

From the yearly price high to the yearly low, that is a  drop of 25.65%.

Since 2014 NAB has been paying a dividend of $0.99 and as of Friday's closing price of $25.70 it equates to an 8% return plus franking credits.

So, how far can they push this down? Did profit fall off a cliff? Royal Commission fines 2,3,4,5 hundred million??? 
Why do you think this will collapse?
