2016-03-31T08:44:00+11:00 : I agree siameseparrot. It's always important to look at all the time frames. 
Daily: The point of the downward crossover on the daily was the 23rd March and if you had shorted NAB for the past week you could have done well. I'm going to say you have missed the boat on shorting opportunities if you used that particular indicator.
4hr : The 4hr is showing signs of turning. see image below. obviously it's got a long way to go as the divergence in the moving averages is still wide but from the picture you can see an eensy bit of it decreasing. I've adding a trend line to show this. see Image attached.
Hourly: I use the hourly as a leading indicator for the larger time frames. A positive crossover on the hourly can then show up on the 4 hourly a few days later, then the daily and so and so forth to weekly, monthly etc. If you look at the minute chart you can see reversals begin. It sometimes leads to a larger time frame but is helpful if it all starts from a really low base. 

I'm hoping that if we have a bullish next couple of days with NAB we will get a positive crossover on the 4hr MACD. If the daily has a crossover above the zero line I would consider this really bullish. Elliot wave 3 perhaps (any Elliot wave fans out there feel free to chime in)

Obviously plenty of ifs in here and I wouldn't just use MACD alone to make investment decisions but they do assist me a bit. Anything can happen and these indicators are best used with caution and are not investment advice and are just my thoughts and as always DYOR.
