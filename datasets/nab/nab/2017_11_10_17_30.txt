The S&P/ASX 200 index (xjo) ended down 0.3 percent, or 20.025 points to 6,029.4.

Australia's metals and mining index .AXMM slipped 1.7 percent, hurt by a fall in iron ore prices.

[IRONORE/] 	Australia's mining heavyweights BHP Billiton (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) lost 2 percent and 2.3 percent apiece. 	Energy stocks also dragged, with the index .AXEJ losing 1.2 percent after crude oil prices pulled back from a recent rally. [O/R] 	Oil and gas producer Santos Ltd (STO) was the biggest weight on the energy index, and ended down 3.4 percent as it extended losses suffered in the previous session on softer 2018 guidance.  	Among other decliners, financials .AXFJ closed slightly down, with three out of the "Big Four" banks falling in the range of 0.03 percent to 0.5 percent. Top loser National Australia Bank (NAB) ended down after trading ex-dividend on Thursday.

The index shed 1.1 percent this week.	  Accounting software firm Xero Ltd (XRO) led the losing stocks on the index, ending down 3.9 percent.
