" In May, the Australian government said it would charge a 6 basis-point levy on the mortgage books of the country's major lenders, a measure to cool the housing market and bolster the federal budget. "

Looks like the levy did not hit NAB that hard,.... contrary to all those talks when the levy was first announced a few months ago.
