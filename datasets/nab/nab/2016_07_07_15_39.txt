People may find the following graphs interesting. They form the basis of my rationale.

The first graph shows price and book value since 2009. Finance theory suggests that when the price approaches book value (ie when B/M is high ie value stocks), future returns will be high. We saw this in 2009 and 2011, with subsequent high returns in following years. The gap is narrowing again. 




The 2nd graph shows PE and gross div yield (GDY)  since 2009. Finance theory suggests that when the dividend yield is high, future returns will be high. We saw this in 2009 and 2011, with subsequent high returns in following years. The lines have crossed again as can be seen in the 3rd graph.
