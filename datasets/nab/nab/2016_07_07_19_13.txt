I think dollar cost averaging is always a good idea when in doubt; jumping in with both feet at any point is rarely a good idea. I don't see any problem with buying "some" NAB right now, I just think it's incredibly wise to keep the majority of powder dry so that if & when that price gets smashed it's simple to pick up some more and average the cost of entry.
