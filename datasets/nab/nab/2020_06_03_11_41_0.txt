2020-06-03T11:41:00+10:00 : Somewhat, but i don't think it's as bad as what everyone is making it out to be.When the SPP was first announced this forum was filled with downrampers quoting $8 in a month dog stock sentiment. From NAB's perspective they probably didn't want to take the risk of waiting a month for retail to make up their minds and possibly not raise what they needed. Insto's are the smart play and dropped ~3b in a day, took retail a month to do that and I would bet that a very large portion of retail applications weren't made until the last minute when share price was trading at a $4 premium.my preferred scenario would have been no div, lower cap raise and a slightly higher allocation split between insto's and retail, but i'm not unhappy either. I got my fair share like everyone else.
