A downramper with good information is worth reading. A bad one can be entertaining but ultimately it's a reflection of their character. It takes a certain lack of compassion to do that to other people and what gets posted here has no effect on the sp but it may effect how you sleep at night if you take it to heart. These people are highly emotional people and would even stoop as low as using their own emotions to tell their wives to sell shares in protest only to see those shares increase in value and therefore negatively impact the value of a portfolio. Ignore mate. Have a better time on HC
