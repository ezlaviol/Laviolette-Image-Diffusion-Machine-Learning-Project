2019-02-12T13:49:00+11:00 : The only detriment to Australia atm is if labor get in, most if not all their policies attempt to block economic growth. Whether this be grandfathering negative gearing = reducing investment in property and in turn reducing construction = reduced employment/jobs in that sector which will flow into other sectors. Or reduced CGT discount from 50% down to 25% = people leaving money in banks, why invest when your taxed on 75% of the gain?Or losing franking credit refunds - less money for the elderly to spend, because you know they love to pile up money towards the end of their life.....If someone can point out a policy that labor want to implement im all ears.As it is, if bank profits are set to be lower along with growth in future periods, the 4 big pillar banks contribute significantly to the tax system. So the government is gonna have to get money elsewhere to ensure the promised surplus is delivered. Interesting times ahead...
