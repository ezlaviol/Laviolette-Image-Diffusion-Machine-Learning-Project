The economic realities will not really be apparent until we see the revised guidance for FY 2020 and probably HY2021. So my guess is this might be more prolonged than some punters would think. How deep it will be will depend on whether the media will not build on the irrationality and Govt is honest about what is happening when it is happening. Both could be a tall ask but you can hope. NAB will of course weather the storm but you will have to hold your nerve IMO.
