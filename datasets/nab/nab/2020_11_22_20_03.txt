2020-11-22T20:03:00+11:00 : I have a few bucks here as well but its a long way back to the yield of a few years ago and also in terms of dividend per shares as well,after I sold down the 4 last year and invested elsewhere I have done much better but having said that I realized that my SMSF was to reliant on finance stocks I had around 60% and the yield was ok but no growth so now I am down to 30% finance but most of that is Macquarie.I have tried to spread my portfolio a bit better but I would have been really smacked if I had not re-balanced away from banks last year.
