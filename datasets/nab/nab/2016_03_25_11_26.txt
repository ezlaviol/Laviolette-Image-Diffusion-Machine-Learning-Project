Personally I sold my CYB CDIs yesterday and churned the proceeds back into NAB. I'm holding long term so if the price drops my DRP will just accumulate more shares every 6 months. I'm sure at some stage in the next 5-10 years banks will rally hard again and at that point I'll be sitting on a nice investment.
