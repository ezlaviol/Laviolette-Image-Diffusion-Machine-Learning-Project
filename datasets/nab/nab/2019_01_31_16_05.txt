2019-01-31T16:05:00+11:00 : Fine Skram to make a capital gain on volatility.Be aware that NAB is showing 8% divi return, so it is a good longtermer too.Used to trade more, but wife who bought and tended to read the paper and go shopping did better on investments in the long term.Think NAB will not better 25 any time soon;given return, 23 and cheaper is a bargain.Will hold value.Each has a plan for profit.
