2016-03-13T22:44:00+11:00 : NAB might be affected by the global violence sweeping the Globe against the establishment, Democracy, Christianity and of course Trump, cafe diners at Federation Square in Melbourne Saturday night. Melbourne is the same city where NAB has its HQ.

Melbourne and Federation Square seems like beset by the same morons that go and create violence at Trump rallies, beating up bystanders, causing problems for Victorian State Police Commissioner Ashton. how will Commissioner Ashton get re-elected? Will NAB support his campaign?

Melbourne has had police officers stabbed by people that revere ISIS.

Some people in America think Trump is the answer to such morons. A pro-economy, zero tolerance policing solution is necessary to stop the nonsense, NAB needs a safe place for its HQ.

African and pacific island gangs do nothing for NAB's return to success. What do we do with these morons? People were barracaded in cafes for 1 and a half hours,
