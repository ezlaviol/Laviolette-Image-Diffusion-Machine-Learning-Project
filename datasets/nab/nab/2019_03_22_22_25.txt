2019-03-22T22:25:00+11:00 : I have one question about FCs under the ruling " anyone on a full or part centrelink benefit as of 28th. March 2018 will retain franking credits. (Age Pensioners, Disability Pensioners, Unemployed, Carers etc etc.) ALSO if 1 member of a SMSF meets the aforesaid criteria the SMSF will receive franking credits."So does that only apply to existing shares you owned as of 28th March 2018?  What about future purchases? IE if I was to buy NAB shares today, would I retain the FC on those shares as well?   I suspect that I would get the FCs on any shares purchased post March 2018 but am not prepared to bet on it.  Plus, IMHO, it would only be a matter of time before Labor revoked that ruling.  Its only there so they can get a foot in the door ( IMHO)
