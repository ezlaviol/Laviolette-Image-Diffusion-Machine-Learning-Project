2020-05-27T19:06:00+10:00 : The $2490 minimum is fair enough in my opinion. I only have a handful of shares, and was expecting to get around $1K as the minimum in case of scale back. I did put more just to anticipate no scale back. There's never a case in any SPP scale back, you'll get $10K if you only have $1K shares to start with, some people just expected too much. As small shareholder, I'm happy to get $2.5K out of the $10K I put (at today's price, that $600 profit if we sell, I take it as we're getting 6% of interest from the $10K I put in 2 weeks, nothing to complain ). Also, for the one paying with BPay, I guess they'd return the surplus to the same account we use for BPay (that's how I normally got mine from other SPP).
