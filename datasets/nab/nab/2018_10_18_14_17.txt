2018-10-18T14:17:00+11:00 : The ‘Building Society’ comment may be slightly ott however compared to overseas banks they have an unusually large exposure to housing (about 35% compared to 50-60%....NAB and ANZ increased their exposure over the past two years, playing catch up. NAB may have once again made another very poor call!). Westpac has always been the most’ Building Society like’ and why their present and past CEOs have been paid so much money for a job any fool could do is one of life’s mysteries.
