Good old reliable blue chip bank stocks, with their ever increasing loan books, their market monopoly, bullet proof dividends and always upwardly marching share price.Sorry buddy, just because something was, does not fortell something will be.Things have changed. Big banks will never be what they were and the market is starting to wake up to this reality.The fact that banks now feel the need to try and bribe consumers into taking loans, by offering thousands of dollars, in an effort to reduce the bloodletting in their loan books should be sounding the alarm bells. interesting times, to be sure.
