No definitely not, I’ve managed my investments appropriately.As someone who is incurring loses on my own investments, I wouldn’t expect to cover some else’s losses as well (with my taxes).Thats simply not right.Of course happy to support ppl with $1100 a fortnight till they find their feet, just not prepared to support investors when I’m struggling myself.
