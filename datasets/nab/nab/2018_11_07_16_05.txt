I have been in two minds about how the share price will come back after Ex. I have come to the conclusion that the market has already well factored in all the bad news for NAB well before the Div was announced. I think this week there will be a quick bounce because of this pre-factoring. I say this on the proviso that the sky doesn't fall in on the market in general.
