It was just pointing out that you shouldnt follow an investment strategy blindly and that government policies do impact upon return unfortunately. Same can be said for shares, you can have shares in a company and if the government passes legislation it can ruin companies. Look at the steel industry in the US after Trumps tariff discussions. Bluescoop Steel in Australia was on its knees trying to ensure it wasnt going to be hit. Government politics can have significant impacts on your investment it definitely should be a factor in investment decisions hence why I would never invest in companies based in theÂ DRC. But there are many other less stable countries out there people put their money in.
