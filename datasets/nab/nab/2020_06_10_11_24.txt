2020-06-10T11:24:00+10:00 : Had a visit from the postie today, no joy!!Hopeful9, our regular postie left some two years ago, after fantastic service, we rewarded him at Xmas time each year.  Occasionally after his run on a Friday he would join us for an ale, we have many home brewers in the street.  An honest man, he never threw anything that looked like a bill down the drain as per my frequent requests.After he left our mail delivery has been sporadic at best.I have always, up until last year rewarded the postie and garbos with a Xmas gift of beer, until year before last when our garbos declined my offer saying it was against the new amalgamated councils rules,Yep the boofheads, who have no idea burst the bubble of thanking someone for a thankless task.
