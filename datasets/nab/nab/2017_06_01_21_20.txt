2017-06-01T21:20:00+10:00 : We had the intraday scare and the red candle today. The important feature is that the finish at 4.11pm was not weak as the approach to 4.00pm.

I still feel $30.60 area. The key is that it does not get too close to and break $29.66.

We need clear stability and signs of strength tomorrow.

Good luck to both long and short holders.
