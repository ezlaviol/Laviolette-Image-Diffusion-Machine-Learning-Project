It hasn't been performing well like I thought it would have. Nevertheless, id like to hold for medium term even though I have no patience and I'm always looking for quick gains. Although I have lost a crap load trying to do that. 
I'd like to see nab peak at $32 for me before I'd consider selling. Just don't know if it has the steam to do so...
