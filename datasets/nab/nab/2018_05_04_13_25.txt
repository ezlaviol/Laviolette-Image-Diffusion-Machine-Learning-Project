2018-05-04T13:25:00+10:00 : Tq REmarks,... have always appreciated ur % loss/gain chart,... as everybody can see, NAB has again dipped the least till now,...

I believe it's more appropriate to compare vs the previous corresponding period, not so much versus the previous immediate period. It's got something to do with 'the fair sampling theory',...

Are you able to include AMP and BOQ into your chart pls ? Thanks again,...
