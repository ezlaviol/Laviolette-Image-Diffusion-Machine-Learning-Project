They should have Shredded the dividend years ago but their incentives are based on share price and some stupid reason they share price is a multiple of the dividend. If the board were good at math they would realise the unsustainable dividends are why the so has been dropping for >10 years.for all your sakes, I hope they keep the 30c div for years to come.
