2020-03-28T20:13:00+11:00 : I think the equation is The burger joint sells for $15 normally.If Uber delivers it they take $5 from the restaurant and the restaurant gets $10.The delivery guy gets the extra $5.Uber takes say 80% of the net profit the restaurant would normally get.The restaurant gets say 20% but if they didn't do it they wouldn't get that.It is for this reason that whilst I would use ride sharing (as taxis have stung me too often) but I wouldn't use Uber eats.
