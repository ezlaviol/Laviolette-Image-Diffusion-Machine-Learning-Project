If you are referring to ASIC charges and possible fines in relation to charging for non existent service it won't be anything like that.
That issue was the main item for NAB from the RC and is currently subject to remediation payments. It is very poor practise and gouging at it's worth, however it pales in criminality compared to the money laundering issues currently haunting Westpac.
(As I have said elsewhere I believe ASIC should go after highly paid execs and thrust accountability onto those people for not doing their job instead of grandstanding after the fact!!- This would be a great opportunity for ASIC to make a stand against high paid officials that are never accountable for anything regardless of the industry)
If NAB gets done for Austrac issues also then that will change things but at the moment it is more about sentiment and trust then concern about severe damage to a bottom line.
Also - I have said before, your comments about NAB (or any bank) becoming a finance company makes absolutely no sense and doesn't actually mean anything
