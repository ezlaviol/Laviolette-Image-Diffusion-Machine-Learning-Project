If I thought 26 was the bottom I'd be all in right now but I'd be very disappointed if it was. Looking for a rough start tomorrow and a recovery. Might not get back to where we finished on Friday but I'm thinking it will be close. Who knows, the last thing we need is Lurkin posting here. We want cheaper shares and Lurkin has a habit of horrible predictions. I would have rathered he showed up when nab was 24ish. It's a bad omen and I fear for what's ahead
