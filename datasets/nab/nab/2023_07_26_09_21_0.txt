2023-07-26T09:21:00+10:00 : The Australian banks appear to be more prone to frauds, scams and money laundering than anything we have seen in America and or England when systems and controls have been world leading for years.Perhaps caps to the dividends and regulatory fines along with damages to customers need to be instituted on banks to improve their behavior and fraud/ scam and money laundering prevention to their customers.Otherwise Aussie banks down there will not learn from their mistakes and wil, continue to under resource their banks.
