I would think that their source of funds are from the RBA,... if not, they would definitely HAVE TO raise interest rates for sure, perhaps not only against investors, but against home buyers who are occupiers as well,...

I sure hope that not that many banks source their funds from the US, not in these times,.. a few years ago would have been fine, but not today ! How about NAB, where do their funds come from ?
