I found that quite interesting and had not looked earlier.....so I had a look at the aud-us over the same time. it flopped around (with higher lows from memory but squeezing) until 12 when it turned down and steadily dived for 3 hours till it really crashed at 3pm down till 4pm (talking gmt-4 so like for like with your chart). I read plenty of arbs into that wbc chart.
