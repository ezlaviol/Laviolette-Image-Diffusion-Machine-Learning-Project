2019-12-09T21:58:00+11:00 : Another year has passed in lazy town. Our lazy man digs out his NAB portfolio from the bottom drawer and reminisces. Let's see. RC has been and gone. The housing market didn't collapse. Another bank is in the bad books with AUSTRAC. Interest rates keep falling. The on again, off again trade wars continue. Fintechs are the new threat; maybe. Hmmmm. Nothing is really new, so meh. Oh wait, better see what the NAB holding is worth now. He updates his spreadsheet from before and it now looks something like this 





So the initial investment of 10K last time was $25 at the end of 2000 is now worth around 51k, the same as if the SP had increased to $130 per share. Oh well, our lazy man mutters as he shrugs his shoulders in apathy, and pops them back into the bottom drawer. Until next year!
