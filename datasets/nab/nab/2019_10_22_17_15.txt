2019-10-22T17:15:00+11:00 : (Updates to close) 	Oct 22 (Reuters) - Australian shares advanced on Tuesday on signs that Washington and Beijing had made some headway in resolving a protracted  trade row, while miners also benefited from a strong tailwind of higher commodity prices.	 	The S&P/ASX 200 index  (xjo)  tacked on 0.3%, or 19.70 points, to 6,672.20, having ended flat the previous day.  	Sentiment improved as China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng on Tuesday said the two countries have achieved some progress in their trade talks, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump made equally positive comments on the prospects for ending the dispute.   	The mining subindex  .AXMM  rose 1% with BHP Group  (BHP)  and Rio Tinto  (RIO) , the largest miners on the benchmark, adding about 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively. 	The uptick was underpinned as supply concerns bolstered prices of iron ore and copper.	 	Financial stocks  .AXFJ  got a lift from National Australia Bank  (NAB)  adding 0.5% and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  (ANZ)  pulling 0.4% ahead.   	Wealth manager AMP Ltd  (AMP)  jumped 2.3% and closed at a 3-week high after its funds management arm announced a $6.2 billion fund raising.   	Energy stocks  .AXEJ  gained after two sessions of declines as oil prices steadied. Beach Energy  (BPT)  added 1.7%, while Viva Energy Group  (VEA)  rallied 4.6%.	 	Elsewhere the business outlook and earnings swayed some of the trading. Among them was Oil Search  (OSH) ,  which declined 1% after it cuts its 2019 production outlook.		Hearing aid maker Cochlear Ltd  (COH)  tumbled 5.5% as the company flagged a lower earnings per share target at its annual general meeting.   	Super Retail Group  (SUL)  plunged 8.6% and was the worst  performer on the ASX benchmark after the company flagged lower margins from increased promotional activities.	   	Retail financial services provider McMillan Shakespeare  (MMS)  fell 4.3% as it signalled challenging market conditions.		New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index  (nz50)  rose 0.3% to 11,090.39.  	Fonterra  (FSF)   (FCG)  advanced 1.3%, after the dairy giant increased the 2019-2020 guidance range for the price it pays farmers to procure milk.
